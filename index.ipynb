    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Now we're going to do some rudimentary analysis of Shakespeare's classic play: Macbeth! You will get practice working with lists and dictionaries, conditionals, visualizing data, and thinking analytically about data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Apply string methods to make changes to a string\n",
    "* Use a `for` loop to iterate over a collection\n",
    "* Assign values in a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting the Data\n",
    "Here we start by importing a Python package called `requests`. We'll use it to pull the transcript of Macbeth from the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) website. We'll also preview a few details about what is now stored in the variable `macbeth`. As you can see, it's a string with 120,253 characters - the first 500 of which are printed below. "

The seruice, and the loyaltie I owe,\\r\\nIn doing it, payes it selfe.\\r\\nYour Highnesse part, is to receiue our Duties:\\r\\nAnd our Duties are to your Throne, and State,\\r\\nChildren, and Seruants; which doe but what they should,\\r\\nBy doing euery thing safe toward your Loue\\r\\nAnd Honor\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Welcome hither:\\r\\nI haue begun to plant thee, and will labour\\r\\nTo make thee full of growing.

My worthy Cawdor\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. The Prince of Cumberland: that is a step,\\r\\nOn which I must fall downe, or else o're-leape,\\r\\nFor in my way it lyes.

They met me in the day of successe: and I haue\\r\\nlearn'd by the perfect'st report, they haue more in them, then\\r\\nmortall knowledge. When I burnt in desire to question them\\r\\nfurther, they made themselues Ayre, into which they vanish'd.\\r\\nWhiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came Missiues from\\r\\nthe King, who all-hail'd me Thane of Cawdor, by which Title\\r\\nbefore, these weyward Sisters saluted me, and referr'd me to\\r\\nthe comming on of time, with haile King that shalt be. This\\r\\nhaue I thought good to deliuer thee (my dearest Partner of\\r\\nGreatnesse) that thou might'st not loose the dues of reioycing\\r\\nby being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis'd thee. Lay\\r\\nit to thy heart and farewell.\\r\\nGlamys thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be\\r\\nWhat thou art promis'd: yet doe I feare thy Nature,\\r\\nIt is too full o'th' Milke of humane kindnesse,\\r\\nTo catch the neerest way.

Come to my Womans Brests,\\r\\nAnd take my Milke for Gall, you murth'ring Ministers,\\r\\nWhere-euer, in your sightlesse substances,\\r\\nYou wait on Natures Mischiefe.

This Guest of Summer,\\r\\nThe Temple-haunting Barlet does approue,\\r\\nBy his loued Mansonry, that the Heauens breath\\r\\nSmells wooingly here: no Iutty frieze,\\r\\nButtrice, nor Coigne of Vantage, but this Bird\\r\\nHath made his pendant Bed, and procreant Cradle,\\r\\nWhere they must breed, and haunt: I haue obseru'd\\r\\nThe ayre is delicate.\\r\\nEnter Lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n  King.

Heere,\\r\\nBut heere, vpon this Banke and Schoole of time,\\r\\nWee'ld iumpe the life to come. But in these Cases,\\r\\nWe still haue iudgement heere, that we but teach\\r\\nBloody Instructions, which being taught, returne\\r\\nTo plague th' Inuenter, this euen-handed Iustice\\r\\nCommends th' Ingredience of our poyson'd Challice\\r\\nTo our owne lips. Hee's heere in double trust;\\r\\nFirst, as I am his Kinsman, and his Subiect,\\r\\nStrong both against the Deed: Then, as his Host,\\r\\nWho should against his Murtherer shut the doore,\\r\\nNot beare the knife my selfe. Besides, this Duncane\\r\\nHath borne his Faculties so meeke; hath bin\\r\\nSo cleere in his great Office, that his Vertues\\r\\nWill pleade like Angels, Trumpet-tongu'd against\\r\\nThe deepe damnation of his taking off:\\r\\nAnd Pitty, like a naked New-borne-Babe,\\r\\nStriding the blast, or Heauens Cherubin, hors'd\\r\\nVpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre,\\r\\nShall blow the horrid deed in euery eye,\\r\\nThat teares shall drowne the winde.

Was the hope drunke,\\r\\nWherein you drest your selfe? Hath it slept since?\\r\\nAnd wakes it now to looke so greene, and pale,\\r\\nAt what it did so freely? From this time,\\r\\nSuch I account thy loue. Art thou affear'd\\r\\nTo be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,\\r\\nAs thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue that\\r\\nWhich thou esteem'st the Ornament of Life,\\r\\nAnd liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?\\r\\nLetting I dare not, wait vpon I would,\\r\\nLike the poore Cat i'th' Addage\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Prythee peace:\\r\\nI dare do all that may become a man,\\r\\nWho dares do more, is none\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. What Beast was't then\\r\\nThat made you breake this enterprize to me?\\r\\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man:\\r\\nAnd to be more then what you were, you would\\r\\nBe so much more the man. Nor time, nor place\\r\\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\\r\\nThey haue made themselues, and that their fitnesse now\\r\\nDo's vnmake you. I haue giuen Sucke, and know\\r\\nHow tender 'tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,\\r\\nI would, while it was smyling in my Face,\\r\\nHaue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes,\\r\\nAnd dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne\\r\\nAs you haue done to this\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb.

Hold, take my Sword:\\r\\nThere's Husbandry in Heauen,\\r\\nTheir Candles are all out: take thee that too.\\r\\nA heauie Summons lyes like Lead vpon me,\\r\\nAnd yet I would not sleepe:\\r\\nMercifull Powers, restraine in me the cursed thoughts\\r\\nThat Nature giues way to in repose.\\r\\nEnter Macbeth, and a Seruant with a Torch.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiue me my Sword: who's there?\\r\\n  Macb.

Being vnprepar'd,\\r\\nOur will became the seruant to defect,\\r\\nWhich else should free haue wrought\\r\\n\\r\\n   Banq. All's well.\\r\\nI dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters:\\r\\nTo you they haue shew'd some truth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. I thinke not of them:\\r\\nYet when we can entreat an houre to serue,\\r\\nWe would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse,\\r\\nIf you would graunt the time\\r\\n\\r\\n   Banq. At your kind'st leysure\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. If you shall cleaue to my consent,\\r\\nWhen 'tis, it shall make Honor for you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Banq.

Get thee to bed.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs this a Dagger, which I see before me,\\r\\nThe Handle toward my Hand? Come, let me clutch thee:\\r\\nI haue thee not, and yet I see thee still.\\r\\nArt thou not fatall Vision, sensible\\r\\nTo feeling, as to sight? or art thou but\\r\\nA Dagger of the Minde, a false Creation,\\r\\nProceeding from the heat-oppressed Braine?\\r\\nI see thee yet, in forme as palpable,\\r\\nAs this which now I draw.\\r\\nThou marshall'st me the way that I was going,\\r\\nAnd such an Instrument I was to vse.\\r\\nMine Eyes are made the fooles o'th' other Sences,\\r\\nOr else worth all the rest: I see thee still;\\r\\nAnd on thy Blade, and Dudgeon, Gouts of Blood,\\r\\nWhich was not so before. There's no such thing:\\r\\nIt is the bloody Businesse, which informes\\r\\nThus to mine Eyes. Now o're the one halfe World\\r\\nNature seemes dead, and wicked Dreames abuse\\r\\nThe Curtain'd sleepe: Witchcraft celebrates\\r\\nPale Heccats Offrings: and wither'd Murther,\\r\\nAlarum'd by his Centinell, the Wolfe,\\r\\nWhose howle's his Watch, thus with his stealthy pace,\\r\\nWith Tarquins rauishing sides, towards his designe\\r\\nMoues like a Ghost. Thou sowre and firme-set Earth\\r\\nHeare not my steps, which they may walke, for feare\\r\\nThy very stones prate of my where-about,\\r\\nAnd take the present horror from the time,\\r\\nWhich now sutes with it. Whiles I threat, he liues:\\r\\nWords to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Bell rings.\\r\\n\\r\\nI goe, and it is done: the Bell inuites me.\\r\\nHeare it not, Duncan, for it is a Knell,\\r\\nThat summons thee to Heauen, or to Hell.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScena Secunda.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n  La.

I haue drugg'd their Possets,\\r\\nThat Death and Nature doe contend about them,\\r\\nWhether they liue, or dye.\\r\\nEnter Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Who's there? what hoa?\\r\\n  Lady. Alack, I am afraid they haue awak'd,\\r\\nAnd 'tis not done: th' attempt, and not the deed,\\r\\nConfounds vs: hearke: I lay'd their Daggers ready,\\r\\nHe could not misse 'em. Had he not resembled\\r\\nMy Father as he slept, I had don't.\\r\\nMy Husband?\\r\\n  Macb. I haue done the deed:\\r\\nDidst thou not heare a noyse?\\r\\n  Lady. I heard the Owle schreame, and the Crickets cry.\\r\\nDid not you speake?\\r\\n  Macb. When?\\r\\n  Lady. Now\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. As I descended?\\r\\n  Lady. I\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Hearke, who lyes i'th' second Chamber?\\r\\n  Lady. Donalbaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. This is a sorry sight\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. There's one did laugh in's sleepe,\\r\\nAnd one cry'd Murther, that they did wake each other:\\r\\nI stood, and heard them: But they did say their Prayers,\\r\\nAnd addrest them againe to sleepe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. There are two lodg'd together\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. One cry'd God blesse vs, and Amen the other,\\r\\nAs they had seene me with these Hangmans hands:\\r\\nListning their feare, I could not say Amen,\\r\\nWhen they did say God blesse vs\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. Consider it not so deepely\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen?\\r\\nI had most need of Blessing, and Amen stuck in my throat\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. These deeds must not be thought\\r\\nAfter these wayes: so, it will make vs mad\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Me thought I heard a voyce cry, Sleep no more:\\r\\nMacbeth does murther Sleepe, the innocent Sleepe,\\r\\nSleepe that knits vp the rauel'd Sleeue of Care,\\r\\nThe death of each dayes Life, sore Labors Bath,\\r\\nBalme of hurt Mindes, great Natures second Course,\\r\\nChiefe nourisher in Life's Feast\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. What doe you meane?\\r\\n  Macb. Still it cry'd, Sleepe no more to all the House:\\r\\nGlamis hath murther'd Sleepe, and therefore Cawdor\\r\\nShall sleepe no more: Macbeth shall sleepe no more\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. Who was it, that thus cry'd? why worthy Thane,\\r\\nYou doe vnbend your Noble strength, to thinke\\r\\nSo braine-sickly of things: Goe get some Water,\\r\\nAnd wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand.\\r\\nWhy did you bring these Daggers from the place?\\r\\nThey must lye there: goe carry them, and smeare\\r\\nThe sleepie Groomes with blood\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Ile goe no more:\\r\\nI am afraid, to thinke what I haue done:\\r\\nLooke on't againe, I dare not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. Infirme of purpose:\\r\\nGiue me the Daggers: the sleeping, and the dead,\\r\\nAre but as Pictures: 'tis the Eye of Childhood,\\r\\nThat feares a painted Deuill.

Marry, Sir, Nose-painting, Sleepe, and Vrine.\\r\\nLecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes\\r\\nthe desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore\\r\\nmuch Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie:\\r\\nit makes him, and it marres him; it sets him on,\\r\\nand it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens\\r\\nhim; makes him stand too, and not stand too: in conclusion,\\r\\nequiuocates him in a sleepe, and giuing him the Lye,\\r\\nleaues him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I beleeue, Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night\\r\\n\\r\\n   Port.

Confusion now hath made his Master-peece:\\r\\nMost sacrilegious Murther hath broke ope\\r\\nThe Lords anoynted Temple, and stole thence\\r\\nThe Life o'th' Building\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. What is't you say, the Life?\\r\\n  Lenox. Meane you his Maiestie?\\r\\n  Macd. Approch the Chamber, and destroy your sight\\r\\nWith a new Gorgon. Doe not bid me speake:\\r\\nSee, and then speake your selues: awake, awake,\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt. Macbeth and Lenox.\\r\\n\\r\\nRing the Alarum Bell: Murther, and Treason,\\r\\nBanquo, and Donalbaine: Malcolme awake,\\r\\nShake off this Downey sleepe, Deaths counterfeit,\\r\\nAnd looke on Death it selfe: vp, vp, and see\\r\\nThe great Doomes Image: Malcolme, Banquo,\\r\\nAs from your Graues rise vp, and walke like Sprights,\\r\\nTo countenance this horror. Ring the Bell.\\r\\n\\r\\nBell rings. Enter Lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. What's the Businesse?\\r\\nThat such a hideous Trumpet calls to parley\\r\\nThe sleepers of the House? speake, speake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O gentle Lady,\\r\\n'Tis not for you to heare what I can speake:\\r\\nThe repetition in a Womans eare,\\r\\nWould murther as it fell.\\r\\nEnter Banquo.\\r\\n\\r\\nO Banquo, Banquo, Our Royall Master's murther'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. Woe, alas:\\r\\nWhat, in our House?\\r\\n  Ban. Too cruell, any where.\\r\\nDeare Duff, I prythee contradict thy selfe,\\r\\nAnd say, it is not so.\\r\\nEnter Macbeth, Lenox, and Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Had I but dy'd an houre before this chance,\\r\\nI had liu'd a blessed time: for from this instant,\\r\\nThere's nothing serious in Mortalitie:\\r\\nAll is but Toyes: Renowne and Grace is dead,\\r\\nThe Wine of Life is drawne, and the meere Lees\\r\\nIs left this Vault, to brag of.\\r\\nEnter Malcolme and Donalbaine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Donal. What is amisse?\\r\\n  Macb. You are, and doe not know't:\\r\\nThe Spring, the Head, the Fountaine of your Blood\\r\\nIs stopt, the very Source of it is stopt\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Your Royall Father's murther'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Oh, by whom?\\r\\n  Lenox. Those of his Chamber, as it seem'd, had don't:\\r\\nTheir Hands and Faces were all badg'd with blood,\\r\\nSo were their Daggers, which vnwip'd, we found\\r\\nVpon their Pillowes: they star'd, and were distracted,\\r\\nNo mans Life was to be trusted with them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. O, yet I doe repent me of my furie,\\r\\nThat I did kill them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Wherefore did you so?\\r\\n  Macb. Who can be wise, amaz'd, temp'rate, & furious,\\r\\nLoyall, and Neutrall, in a moment? No man:\\r\\nTh' expedition of my violent Loue\\r\\nOut-run the pawser, Reason. Here lay Duncan,\\r\\nHis Siluer skinne, lac'd with His Golden Blood,\\r\\nAnd his gash'd Stabs, look'd like a Breach in Nature,\\r\\nFor Ruines wastfull entrance: there the Murtherers,\\r\\nSteep'd in the Colours of their Trade; their Daggers\\r\\nVnmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refraine,\\r\\nThat had a heart to loue; and in that heart,\\r\\nCourage, to make's loue knowne?\\r\\n  Lady. Helpe me hence, hoa\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Looke to the Lady\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Why doe we hold our tongues,\\r\\nThat most may clayme this argument for ours?\\r\\n  Donal. What should be spoken here,\\r\\nWhere our Fate hid in an augure hole,\\r\\nMay rush, and seize vs? Let's away,\\r\\nOur Teares are not yet brew'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Nor our strong Sorrow\\r\\nVpon the foot of Motion\\r\\n\\r\\n   Banq. Looke to the Lady:\\r\\nAnd when we haue our naked Frailties hid,\\r\\nThat suffer in exposure; let vs meet,\\r\\nAnd question this most bloody piece of worke,\\r\\nTo know it further. Feares and scruples shake vs:\\r\\nIn the great Hand of God I stand, and thence,\\r\\nAgainst the vndivulg'd pretence, I fight\\r\\nOf Treasonous Mallice\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And so doe I\\r\\n\\r\\n   All. So all\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Let's briefely put on manly readinesse,\\r\\nAnd meet i'th' Hall together\\r\\n\\r\\n   All. Well contented.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Malc. What will you doe?\\r\\nLet's not consort with them:\\r\\nTo shew an vnfelt Sorrow, is an Office\\r\\nWhich the false man do's easie.\\r\\nIle to England\\r\\n\\r\\n   Don. To Ireland, I:\\r\\nOur seperated fortune shall keepe vs both the safer:\\r\\nWhere we are, there's Daggers in mens smiles;\\r\\nThe neere in blood, the neerer bloody\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. This murtherous Shaft that's shot,\\r\\nHath not yet lighted: and our safest way,\\r\\nIs to auoid the ayme. Therefore to Horse,\\r\\nAnd let vs not be daintie of leaue-taking,\\r\\nBut shift away: there's warrant in that Theft,\\r\\nWhich steales it selfe, when there's no mercie left.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScena Quarta.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Rosse, with an Old man.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Old man. Threescore and ten I can remember well,\\r\\nWithin the Volume of which Time, I haue seene\\r\\nHoures dreadfull, and things strange: but this sore Night\\r\\nHath trifled former knowings\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Ha, good Father,\\r\\nThou seest the Heauens, as troubled with mans Act,\\r\\nThreatens his bloody Stage: byth' Clock 'tis Day,\\r\\nAnd yet darke Night strangles the trauailing Lampe:\\r\\nIs't Nights predominance, or the Dayes shame,\\r\\nThat Darknesse does the face of Earth intombe,\\r\\nWhen liuing Light should kisse it?\\r\\n  Old man. 'Tis vnnaturall,\\r\\nEuen like the deed that's done: On Tuesday last,\\r\\nA Faulcon towring in her pride of place,\\r\\nWas by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at, and kill'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. And Duncans Horses,\\r\\n(A thing most strange, and certaine)\\r\\nBeauteous, and swift, the Minions of their Race,\\r\\nTurn'd wilde in nature, broke their stalls, flong out,\\r\\nContending 'gainst Obedience, as they would\\r\\nMake Warre with Mankinde\\r\\n\\r\\n   Old man. 'Tis said, they eate each other\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. They did so:\\r\\nTo th' amazement of mine eyes that look'd vpon't.\\r\\nEnter Macduffe.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeere comes the good Macduffe.\\r\\nHow goes the world Sir, now?\\r\\n  Macd. Why see you not?\\r\\n  Ross. Is't known who did this more then bloody deed?\\r\\n  Macd. Those that Macbeth hath slaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ross. Alas the day,\\r\\nWhat good could they pretend?\\r\\n  Macd. They were subborned,\\r\\nMalcolme, and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes\\r\\nAre stolne away and fled, which puts vpon them\\r\\nSuspition of the deed\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. 'Gainst Nature still,\\r\\nThriftlesse Ambition, that will rauen vp\\r\\nThine owne liues meanes: Then 'tis most like,\\r\\nThe Soueraignty will fall vpon Macbeth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. He is already nam'd, and gone to Scone\\r\\nTo be inuested\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Where is Duncans body?\\r\\n  Macd. Carried to Colmekill,\\r\\nThe Sacred Store-house of his Predecessors,\\r\\nAnd Guardian of their Bones\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Will you to Scone?\\r\\n  Macd. No Cosin, Ile to Fife\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Well, I will thither\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Well may you see things wel done there: Adieu\\r\\nLeast our old Robes sit easier then our new\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Farewell, Father\\r\\n\\r\\n   Old M. Gods benyson go with you, and with those\\r\\nThat would make good of bad, and Friends of Foes.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt. omnes\\r\\n\\r\\nActus Tertius. Scena Prima.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Banquo.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Banq. Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,\\r\\nAs the weyard Women promis'd, and I feare\\r\\nThou playd'st most fowly for't: yet it was saide\\r\\nIt should not stand in thy Posterity,\\r\\nBut that my selfe should be the Roote, and Father\\r\\nOf many Kings. If there come truth from them,\\r\\nAs vpon thee Macbeth, their Speeches shine,\\r\\nWhy by the verities on thee made good,\\r\\nMay they not be my Oracles as well,\\r\\nAnd set me vp in hope. But hush, no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenit sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Lenox, Rosse, Lords,\\r\\nand\\r\\nAttendants.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Heere's our chiefe Guest\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. If he had beene forgotten,\\r\\nIt had bene as a gap in our great Feast,\\r\\nAnd all-thing vnbecomming\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. To night we hold a solemne Supper sir,\\r\\nAnd Ile request your presence\\r\\n\\r\\n   Banq. Let your Highnesse\\r\\nCommand vpon me, to the which my duties\\r\\nAre with a most indissoluble tye\\r\\nFor euer knit\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Ride you this afternoone?\\r\\n  Ban.

We should haue else desir'd your good aduice\\r\\n(Which still hath been both graue, and prosperous)\\r\\nIn this dayes Councell: but wee'le take to morrow.\\r\\nIs't farre you ride?\\r\\n  Ban. As farre, my Lord, as will fill vp the time\\r\\n'Twixt this, and Supper. Goe not my Horse the better,\\r\\nI must become a borrower of the Night,\\r\\nFor a darke houre, or twaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Faile not our Feast\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ban. My Lord, I will not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. We heare our bloody Cozens are bestow'd\\r\\nIn England, and in Ireland, not confessing\\r\\nTheir cruell Parricide, filling their hearers\\r\\nWith strange inuention. But of that to morrow,\\r\\nWhen therewithall, we shall haue cause of State,\\r\\nCrauing vs ioyntly. Hye you to Horse:\\r\\nAdieu, till you returne at Night.\\r\\nGoes Fleance with you?\\r\\n  Ban.

Bring them before vs.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Seruant.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be thus, is nothing, but to be safely thus\\r\\nOur feares in Banquo sticke deepe,\\r\\nAnd in his Royaltie of Nature reignes that\\r\\nWhich would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,\\r\\nAnd to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde,\\r\\nHe hath a Wisdome, that doth guide his Valour,\\r\\nTo act in safetie. There is none but he,\\r\\nWhose being I doe feare: and vnder him,\\r\\nMy Genius is rebuk'd, as it is said\\r\\nMark Anthonies was by Caesar. He chid the Sisters,\\r\\nWhen first they put the Name of King vpon me,\\r\\nAnd bad them speake to him. Then Prophet-like,\\r\\nThey hayl'd him Father to a Line of Kings.\\r\\nVpon my Head they plac'd a fruitlesse Crowne,\\r\\nAnd put a barren Scepter in my Gripe,\\r\\nThence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand,\\r\\nNo Sonne of mine succeeding: if't be so,\\r\\nFor Banquo's Issue haue I fil'd my Minde,\\r\\nFor them, the gracious Duncan haue I murther'd,\\r\\nPut Rancours in the Vessell of my Peace\\r\\nOnely for them, and mine eternall Iewell\\r\\nGiuen to the common Enemie of Man,\\r\\nTo make them Kings, the Seedes of Banquo Kings.\\r\\nRather then so, come Fate into the Lyst,\\r\\nAnd champion me to th' vtterance.\\r\\nWho's there?\\r\\nEnter Seruant, and two Murtherers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow goe to the Doore, and stay there till we call.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Seruant.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas it not yesterday we spoke together?\\r\\n  Murth.

Sit worthy Friends: my Lord is often thus,\\r\\nAnd hath beene from his youth. Pray you keepe Seat,\\r\\nThe fit is momentary, vpon a thought\\r\\nHe will againe be well. If much you note him\\r\\nYou shall offend him, and extend his Passion,\\r\\nFeed, and regard him not. Are you a man?\\r\\n  Macb. I, and a bold one, that dare looke on that\\r\\nWhich might appall the Diuell\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. O proper stuffe:\\r\\nThis is the very painting of your feare:\\r\\nThis is the Ayre-drawne-Dagger which you said\\r\\nLed you to Duncan. O, these flawes and starts\\r\\n(Impostors to true feare) would well become\\r\\nA womans story, at a Winters fire\\r\\nAuthoriz'd by her Grandam: shame it selfe,\\r\\nWhy do you make such faces? When all's done\\r\\nYou looke but on a stoole\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Prythee see there:\\r\\nBehold, looke, loe, how say you:\\r\\nWhy what care I, if thou canst nod, speake too.\\r\\nIf Charnell houses, and our Graues must send\\r\\nThose that we bury, backe; our Monuments\\r\\nShall be the Mawes of Kytes\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. What? quite vnmann'd in folly\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. If I stand heere, I saw him\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Fie for shame\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Blood hath bene shed ere now, i'th' olden time\\r\\nEre humane Statute purg'd the gentle Weale:\\r\\nI, and since too, Murthers haue bene perform'd\\r\\nToo terrible for the eare. The times has bene,\\r\\nThat when the Braines were out, the man would dye,\\r\\nAnd there an end: But now they rise againe\\r\\nWith twenty mortall murthers on their crownes,\\r\\nAnd push vs from our stooles. This is more strange\\r\\nThen such a murther is\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. My worthy Lord\\r\\nYour Noble Friends do lacke you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. I do forget:\\r\\nDo not muse at me my most worthy Friends,\\r\\nI haue a strange infirmity, which is nothing\\r\\nTo those that know me. Come, loue and health to all,\\r\\nThen Ile sit downe: Giue me some Wine, fill full:\\r\\nEnter Ghost.\\r\\n\\r\\nI drinke to th' generall ioy o'th' whole Table,\\r\\nAnd to our deere Friend Banquo, whom we misse:\\r\\nWould he were heere: to all, and him we thirst,\\r\\nAnd all to all\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lords. Our duties, and the pledge\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. Auant, & quit my sight, let the earth hide thee:\\r\\nThy bones are marrowlesse, thy blood is cold:\\r\\nThou hast no speculation in those eyes\\r\\nWhich thou dost glare with\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Thinke of this good Peeres\\r\\nBut as a thing of Custome: 'Tis no other,\\r\\nOnely it spoyles the pleasure of the time\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. What man dare, I dare:\\r\\nApproach thou like the rugged Russian Beare,\\r\\nThe arm'd Rhinoceros, or th' Hircan Tiger,\\r\\nTake any shape but that, and my firme Nerues\\r\\nShall neuer tremble. Or be aliue againe,\\r\\nAnd dare me to the Desart with thy Sword:\\r\\nIf trembling I inhabit then, protest mee\\r\\nThe Baby of a Girle. Hence horrible shadow,\\r\\nVnreall mock'ry hence. Why so, being gone\\r\\nI am a man againe: pray you sit still\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. You haue displac'd the mirth,\\r\\nBroke the good meeting, with most admir'd disorder\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Can such things be,\\r\\nAnd ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd,\\r\\nWithout our speciall wonder? You make me strange\\r\\nEuen to the disposition that I owe,\\r\\nWhen now I thinke you can behold such sights,\\r\\nAnd keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes,\\r\\nWhen mine is blanch'd with feare\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. What sights, my Lord?\\r\\n  La. I pray you speake not: he growes worse & worse\\r\\nQuestion enrages him: at once, goodnight.\\r\\nStand not vpon the order of your going,\\r\\nBut go at once\\r\\n\\r\\n   Len. Good night, and better health\\r\\nAttend his Maiesty\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. A kinde goodnight to all.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Lords.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. It will haue blood they say:\\r\\nBlood will haue Blood:\\r\\nStones haue beene knowne to moue, & Trees to speake:\\r\\nAugures, and vnderstood Relations, haue\\r\\nBy Maggot Pyes, & Choughes, & Rookes brought forth\\r\\nThe secret'st man of Blood. What is the night?\\r\\n  La. Almost at oddes with morning, which is which\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person\\r\\nAt our great bidding\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Did you send to him Sir?\\r\\n  Macb. I heare it by the way: But I will send:\\r\\nThere's not a one of them but in his house\\r\\nI keepe a Seruant Feed. I will to morrow\\r\\n(And betimes I will) to the weyard Sisters.\\r\\nMore shall they speake: for now I am bent to know\\r\\nBy the worst meanes, the worst, for mine owne good,\\r\\nAll causes shall giue way. I am in blood\\r\\nStept in so farre, that should I wade no more,\\r\\nReturning were as tedious as go ore:\\r\\nStrange things I haue in head, that will to hand,\\r\\nWhich must be acted, ere they may be scand\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. You lacke the season of all Natures, sleepe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Come, wee'l to sleepe: My strange & self-abuse\\r\\nIs the initiate feare, that wants hard vse:\\r\\nWe are yet but yong indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScena Quinta.\\r\\n\\r\\nThunder. Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecat.\\r\\n\\r\\n  1. Why how now Hecat, you looke angerly?\\r\\n  Hec. Haue I not reason (Beldams) as you are?\\r\\nSawcy, and ouer-bold, how did you dare\\r\\nTo Trade, and Trafficke with Macbeth,\\r\\nIn Riddles, and Affaires of death;\\r\\nAnd I the Mistris of your Charmes,\\r\\nThe close contriuer of all harmes,\\r\\nWas neuer call'd to beare my part,\\r\\nOr shew the glory of our Art?\\r\\nAnd which is worse, all you haue done\\r\\nHath bene but for a wayward Sonne,\\r\\nSpightfull, and wrathfull, who (as others do)\\r\\nLoues for his owne ends, not for you.\\r\\nBut make amends now: Get you gon,\\r\\nAnd at the pit of Acheron\\r\\nMeete me i'th' Morning: thither he\\r\\nWill come, to know his Destinie.\\r\\nYour Vessels, and your Spels prouide,\\r\\nYour Charmes, and euery thing beside;\\r\\nI am for th' Ayre: This night Ile spend\\r\\nVnto a dismall, and a Fatall end.\\r\\nGreat businesse must be wrought ere Noone.\\r\\nVpon the Corner of the Moone\\r\\nThere hangs a vap'rous drop, profound,\\r\\nIle catch it ere it come to ground;\\r\\nAnd that distill'd by Magicke slights,\\r\\nShall raise such Artificiall Sprights,\\r\\nAs by the strength of their illusion,\\r\\nShall draw him on to his Confusion.\\r\\nHe shall spurne Fate, scorne Death, and beare\\r\\nHis hopes 'boue Wisedome, Grace, and Feare:\\r\\nAnd you all know, Security\\r\\nIs Mortals cheefest Enemie.\\r\\n\\r\\nMusicke, and a Song.\\r\\n\\r\\nHearke, I am call'd: my little Spirit see\\r\\nSits in Foggy cloud, and stayes for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nSing within. Come away, come away, &c.\\r\\n\\r\\n  1 Come, let's make hast, shee'l soone be\\r\\nBacke againe.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScaena Sexta.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Lenox, and another Lord.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lenox. My former Speeches,\\r\\nHaue but hit your Thoughts\\r\\nWhich can interpret farther: Onely I say\\r\\nThings haue bin strangely borne. The gracious Duncan\\r\\nWas pittied of Macbeth: marry he was dead:\\r\\nAnd the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,\\r\\nWhom you may say (if't please you) Fleans kill'd,\\r\\nFor Fleans fled: Men must not walke too late.\\r\\nWho cannot want the thought, how monstrous\\r\\nIt was for Malcolme, and for Donalbane\\r\\nTo kill their gracious Father? Damned Fact,\\r\\nHow it did greeue Macbeth? Did he not straight\\r\\nIn pious rage, the two delinquents teare,\\r\\nThat were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles of sleepe?\\r\\nWas not that Nobly done? I, and wisely too:\\r\\nFor 'twould haue anger'd any heart aliue\\r\\nTo heare the men deny't. So that I say,\\r\\nHe ha's borne all things well, and I do thinke,\\r\\nThat had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key,\\r\\n(As, and't please Heauen he shall not) they should finde\\r\\nWhat 'twere to kill a Father: So should Fleans.\\r\\nBut peace; for from broad words, and cause he fayl'd\\r\\nHis presence at the Tyrants Feast, I heare\\r\\nMacduffe liues in disgrace. Sir, can you tell\\r\\nWhere he bestowes himselfe?\\r\\n  Lord. The Sonnes of Duncane\\r\\n(From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth)\\r\\nLiues in the English Court, and is receyu'd\\r\\nOf the most Pious Edward, with such grace,\\r\\nThat the maleuolence of Fortune, nothing\\r\\nTakes from his high respect. Thither Macduffe\\r\\nIs gone, to pray the Holy King, vpon his ayd\\r\\nTo wake Northumberland, and warlike Seyward,\\r\\nThat by the helpe of these (with him aboue)\\r\\nTo ratifie the Worke) we may againe\\r\\nGiue to our Tables meate, sleepe to our Nights:\\r\\nFree from our Feasts, and Banquets bloody kniues;\\r\\nDo faithfull Homage, and receiue free Honors,\\r\\nAll which we pine for now. And this report\\r\\nHath so exasperate their King, that hee\\r\\nPrepares for some attempt of Warre\\r\\n\\r\\n   Len. Sent he to Macduffe?\\r\\n  Lord. He did: and with an absolute Sir, not I\\r\\nThe clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe,\\r\\nAnd hums; as who should say, you'l rue the time\\r\\nThat clogges me with this Answer\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lenox. And that well might\\r\\nAduise him to a Caution, t' hold what distance\\r\\nHis wisedome can prouide. Some holy Angell\\r\\nFlye to the Court of England, and vnfold\\r\\nHis Message ere he come, that a swift blessing\\r\\nMay soone returne to this our suffering Country,\\r\\nVnder a hand accurs'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lord. Ile send my Prayers with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nActus Quartus. Scena Prima.\\r\\n\\r\\nThunder.

I coniure you, by that which you Professe,\\r\\n(How ere you come to know it) answer me:\\r\\nThough you vntye the Windes, and let them fight\\r\\nAgainst the Churches: Though the yesty Waues\\r\\nConfound and swallow Nauigation vp:\\r\\nThough bladed Corne be lodg'd, & Trees blown downe,\\r\\nThough Castles topple on their Warders heads:\\r\\nThough Pallaces, and Pyramids do slope\\r\\nTheir heads to their Foundations: Though the treasure\\r\\nOf Natures Germaine, tumble altogether,\\r\\nEuen till destruction sicken: Answer me\\r\\nTo what I aske you\\r\\n\\r\\n   1 Speake\\r\\n\\r\\n   2 Demand\\r\\n\\r\\n   3 Wee'l answer\\r\\n\\r\\n   1 Say, if th'hadst rather heare it from our mouthes,\\r\\nOr from our Masters\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb.

Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth:\\r\\nBeware Macduffe,\\r\\nBeware the Thane of Fife: dismisse me. Enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe Descends.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. What ere thou art, for thy good caution, thanks\\r\\nThou hast harp'd my feare aright.

Be bloody, bold, & resolute:\\r\\nLaugh to scorne\\r\\nThe powre of man: For none of woman borne\\r\\nShall harme Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescends.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mac. Then liue Macduffe: what need I feare of thee?\\r\\nBut yet Ile make assurance: double sure,\\r\\nAnd take a Bond of Fate: thou shalt not liue,\\r\\nThat I may tell pale-hearted Feare, it lies;\\r\\nAnd sleepe in spight of Thunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThunder 3 Apparation, a Childe Crowned, with a Tree in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is this, that rises like the issue of a King,\\r\\nAnd weares vpon his Baby-brow, the round\\r\\nAnd top of Soueraignty?\\r\\n  All. Listen, but speake not too't\\r\\n\\r\\n   3 Appar. Be Lyon metled, proud, and take no care:\\r\\nWho chafes, who frets, or where Conspirers are:\\r\\nMacbeth shall neuer vanquish'd be, vntill\\r\\nGreat Byrnam Wood, to high Dunsmane Hill\\r\\nShall come against him.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescend.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb.

Sweet boadments, good:\\r\\nRebellious dead, rise neuer till the Wood\\r\\nOf Byrnan rise, and our high plac'd Macbeth\\r\\nShall liue the Lease of Nature, pay his breath\\r\\nTo time, and mortall Custome. Yet my Hart\\r\\nThrobs to know one thing: Tell me, if your Art\\r\\nCan tell so much: Shall Banquo's issue euer\\r\\nReigne in this Kingdome?\\r\\n  All. Seeke to know no more\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. I will be satisfied.

Thou art too like the Spirit of Banquo: Down:\\r\\nThy Crowne do's seare mine Eye-bals. And thy haire\\r\\nThou other Gold-bound-brow, is like the first:\\r\\nA third, is like the former. Filthy Hagges,\\r\\nWhy do you shew me this? - A fourth? Start eyes!\\r\\nWhat will the Line stretch out to'th' cracke of Doome?\\r\\nAnother yet? A seauenth?

You know not\\r\\nWhether it was his wisedome, or his feare\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,\\r\\nHis Mansion, and his Titles, in a place\\r\\nFrom whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,\\r\\nHe wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren\\r\\n(The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,\\r\\nHer yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:\\r\\nAll is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;\\r\\nAs little is the Wisedome, where the flight\\r\\nSo runnes against all reason\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. My deerest Cooz,\\r\\nI pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,\\r\\nHe is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes\\r\\nThe fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,\\r\\nBut cruell are the times, when we are Traitors\\r\\nAnd do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor\\r\\nFrom what we feare, yet know not what we feare,\\r\\nBut floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea\\r\\nEach way, and moue.

Nay how will you do for a Husband?\\r\\n  Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Thou speak'st withall thy wit,\\r\\nAnd yet I'faith with wit enough for thee\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?\\r\\n  Wife. I, that he was\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. What is a Traitor?\\r\\n  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,\\r\\nAnd must be hang'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?\\r\\n  Wife. Euery one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Who must hang them?\\r\\n  Wife. Why, the honest men\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there\\r\\nare Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,\\r\\nand hang vp them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:\\r\\nBut how wilt thou do for a Father?\\r\\n  Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you\\r\\nwould not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely\\r\\nhaue a new Father\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife.

But I remember now\\r\\nI am in this earthly world: where to do harme\\r\\nIs often laudable, to do good sometime\\r\\nAccounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)\\r\\nDo I put vp that womanly defence,\\r\\nTo say I haue done no harme?\\r\\nWhat are these faces?\\r\\nEnter Murtherers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mur. Where is your Husband?\\r\\n  Wife.

What I beleeue, Ile waile;\\r\\nWhat know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,\\r\\nAs I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.\\r\\nWhat you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.\\r\\nThis Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\\r\\nWas once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,\\r\\nHe hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something\\r\\nYou may discerne of him through me, and wisedome\\r\\nTo offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe\\r\\nT' appease an angry God\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I am not treacherous\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. But Macbeth is.\\r\\nA good and vertuous Nature may recoyle\\r\\nIn an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:\\r\\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;\\r\\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell.\\r\\nThough all things foule, would wear the brows of grace\\r\\nYet Grace must still looke so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Perchance euen there\\r\\nWhere I did finde my doubts.\\r\\nWhy in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?\\r\\nThose precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,\\r\\nWithout leaue-taking. I pray you,\\r\\nLet not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,\\r\\nBut mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,\\r\\nWhat euer I shall thinke\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,\\r\\nGreat Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,\\r\\nFor goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,\\r\\nThe Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,\\r\\nI would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,\\r\\nFor the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,\\r\\nAnd the rich East to boot\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Be not offended:\\r\\nI speake not as in absolute feare of you:\\r\\nI thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,\\r\\nIt weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\\r\\nIs added to her wounds. I thinke withall,\\r\\nThere would be hands vplifted in my right:\\r\\nAnd heere from gracious England haue I offer\\r\\nOf goodly thousands. But for all this,\\r\\nWhen I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,\\r\\nOr weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country\\r\\nShall haue more vices then it had before,\\r\\nMore suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,\\r\\nBy him that shall succeede\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What should he be?\\r\\n  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know\\r\\nAll the particulars of Vice so grafted,\\r\\nThat when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth\\r\\nWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State\\r\\nEsteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd\\r\\nWith my confinelesse harmes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Not in the Legions\\r\\nOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd\\r\\nIn euils, to top Macbeth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. I grant him Bloody,\\r\\nLuxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,\\r\\nSodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne\\r\\nThat ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none\\r\\nIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,\\r\\nYour Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp\\r\\nThe Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire\\r\\nAll continent Impediments would ore-beare\\r\\nThat did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,\\r\\nThen such an one to reigne\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Boundlesse intemperance\\r\\nIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene\\r\\nTh' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,\\r\\nAnd fall of many Kings. But feare not yet\\r\\nTo take vpon you what is yours: you may\\r\\nConuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\\r\\nAnd yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:\\r\\nWe haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be\\r\\nThat Vulture in you, to deuoure so many\\r\\nAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,\\r\\nFinding it so inclinde\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. With this, there growes\\r\\nIn my most ill-composd Affection, such\\r\\nA stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,\\r\\nI should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,\\r\\nDesire his Iewels, and this others House,\\r\\nAnd my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce\\r\\nTo make me hunger more, that I should forge\\r\\nQuarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,\\r\\nDestroying them for wealth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. This Auarice\\r\\nstickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote\\r\\nThen Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin\\r\\nThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,\\r\\nScotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will\\r\\nOf your meere Owne. All these are portable,\\r\\nWith other Graces weigh'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,\\r\\nAs Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,\\r\\nBounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,\\r\\nDeuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,\\r\\nI haue no rellish of them, but abound\\r\\nIn the diuision of each seuerall Crime,\\r\\nActing it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should\\r\\nPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,\\r\\nVprore the vniuersall peace, confound\\r\\nAll vnity on earth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:\\r\\nI am as I haue spoken\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!\\r\\nWith an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,\\r\\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?\\r\\nSince that the truest Issue of thy Throne\\r\\nBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,\\r\\nAnd do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father\\r\\nWas a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,\\r\\nOftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,\\r\\nDy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,\\r\\nThese Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,\\r\\nHath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,\\r\\nThy hope ends heere\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion\\r\\nChilde of integrity, hath from my soule\\r\\nWip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts\\r\\nTo thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,\\r\\nBy many of these traines, hath sought to win me\\r\\nInto his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me\\r\\nFrom ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue\\r\\nDeale betweene thee and me; For euen now\\r\\nI put my selfe to thy Direction, and\\r\\nVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure\\r\\nThe taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,\\r\\nFor strangers to my Nature. I am yet\\r\\nVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,\\r\\nScarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.\\r\\nAt no time broke my Faith, would not betray\\r\\nThe Deuill to his Fellow, and delight\\r\\nNo lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking\\r\\nWas this vpon my selfe. What I am truly\\r\\nIs thine, and my poore Countries to command:\\r\\nWhither indeed, before they heere approach\\r\\nOld Seyward with ten thousand warlike men\\r\\nAlready at a point, was setting foorth:\\r\\nNow wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse\\r\\nBe like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?\\r\\n  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once\\r\\n'Tis hard to reconcile.\\r\\nEnter a Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth\\r\\nI pray you?\\r\\n  Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched Soules\\r\\nThat stay his Cure: their malady conuinces\\r\\nThe great assay of Art. But at his touch,\\r\\nSuch sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,\\r\\nThey presently amend.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. I thanke you Doctor\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What's the Disease he meanes?\\r\\n  Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.\\r\\nA most myraculous worke in this good King,\\r\\nWhich often since my heere remaine in England,\\r\\nI haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen\\r\\nHimselfe best knowes: but strangely visited people\\r\\nAll swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,\\r\\nThe meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,\\r\\nHanging a golden stampe about their neckes,\\r\\nPut on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken\\r\\nTo the succeeding Royalty he leaues\\r\\nThe healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,\\r\\nHe hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,\\r\\nAnd sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,\\r\\nThat speake him full of Grace.\\r\\nEnter Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macd. See who comes heere\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue\\r\\nThe meanes that makes vs Strangers\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Sir, Amen\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?\\r\\n  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,\\r\\nAlmost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot\\r\\nBe call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing\\r\\nBut who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:\\r\\nWhere sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre\\r\\nAre made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes\\r\\nA Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,\\r\\nIs there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues\\r\\nExpire before the Flowers in their Caps,\\r\\nDying, or ere they sicken\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. What's the newest griefe?\\r\\n  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,\\r\\nEach minute teemes a new one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. How do's my Wife?\\r\\n  Rosse. Why well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And all my Children?\\r\\n  Rosse. Well too\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace?\\r\\n  Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em\\r\\n  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?\\r\\n  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings\\r\\nWhich I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour\\r\\nOf many worthy Fellowes, that were out,\\r\\nWhich was to my beleefe witnest the rather,\\r\\nFor that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.\\r\\nNow is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland\\r\\nWould create Soldiours, make our women fight,\\r\\nTo doffe their dire distresses\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Bee't their comfort\\r\\nWe are comming thither: Gracious England hath\\r\\nLent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,\\r\\nAn older, and a better Souldier, none\\r\\nThat Christendome giues out\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Would I could answer\\r\\nThis comfort with the like. But I haue words\\r\\nThat would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,\\r\\nWhere hearing should not latch them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What concerne they,\\r\\nThe generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe\\r\\nDue to some single brest?\\r\\n  Rosse. No minde that's honest\\r\\nBut in it shares some woe, though the maine part\\r\\nPertaines to you alone\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. If it be mine\\r\\nKeepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,\\r\\nWhich shall possesse them with the heauiest sound\\r\\nthat euer yet they heard\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Humh: I guesse at it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes\\r\\nSauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner\\r\\nWere on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere\\r\\nTo adde the death of you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Mercifull Heauen:\\r\\nWhat man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:\\r\\nGiue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,\\r\\nWhispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. My Children too?\\r\\n  Ro. Wife, Children, Seruants, all that could be found\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And I must be from thence? My wife kil'd too?\\r\\n  Rosse. I haue said\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Be comforted.\\r\\nLet's make vs Med'cines of our great Reuenge,\\r\\nTo cure this deadly greefe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. He ha's no Children. All my pretty ones?\\r\\nDid you say All? Oh Hell-Kite! All?\\r\\nWhat, All my pretty Chickens, and their Damme\\r\\nAt one fell swoope?\\r\\n  Malc. Dispute it like a man\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I shall do so:\\r\\nBut I must also feele it as a man;\\r\\nI cannot but remember such things were\\r\\nThat were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,\\r\\nAnd would not take their part? Sinfull Macduff,\\r\\nThey were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,\\r\\nNot for their owne demerits, but for mine\\r\\nFell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefe\\r\\nConuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O I could play the woman with mine eyes,\\r\\nAnd Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,\\r\\nCut short all intermission: Front to Front,\\r\\nBring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfe\\r\\nWithin my Swords length set him, if he scape\\r\\nHeauen forgiue him too\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. This time goes manly:\\r\\nCome go we to the King, our Power is ready,\\r\\nOur lacke is nothing but our leaue. Macbeth\\r\\nIs ripe for shaking, and the Powres aboue\\r\\nPut on their Instruments: Receiue what cheere you may,\\r\\nThe Night is long, that neuer findes the Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nActus Quintus. Scena Prima.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter a Doctor of Physicke, and a Wayting Gentlewoman.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Doct. I haue too Nights watch'd with you, but can\\r\\nperceiue no truth in your report. When was it shee last\\r\\nwalk'd?\\r\\n  Gent. Since his Maiesty went into the Field, I haue\\r\\nseene her rise from her bed, throw her Night-Gown vppon\\r\\nher, vnlocke her Closset, take foorth paper, folde it,\\r\\nwrite vpon't, read it, afterwards Seale it, and againe returne\\r\\nto bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. A great perturbation in Nature, to receyue at\\r\\nonce the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching.\\r\\nIn this slumbry agitation, besides her walking, and other\\r\\nactuall performances, what (at any time) haue you heard\\r\\nher say?\\r\\n  Gent. That Sir, which I will not report after her\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent.

How came she by that light?\\r\\n  Gent. Why it stood by her: she ha's light by her continually,\\r\\n'tis her command\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. You see her eyes are open\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. I, but their sense are shut\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. What is it she do's now?\\r\\nLooke how she rubbes her hands\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. It is an accustom'd action with her, to seeme\\r\\nthus washing her hands: I haue knowne her continue in\\r\\nthis a quarter of an houre\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lad. Yet heere's a spot\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Heark, she speaks, I will set downe what comes\\r\\nfrom her, to satisfie my remembrance the more strongly\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Out damned spot: out I say. One: Two: Why\\r\\nthen 'tis time to doo't: Hell is murky. Fye, my Lord, fie,\\r\\na Souldier, and affear'd? what need we feare? who knowes\\r\\nit, when none can call our powre to accompt: yet who\\r\\nwould haue thought the olde man to haue had so much\\r\\nblood in him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Do you marke that?\\r\\n  Lad. The Thane of Fife, had a wife: where is she now?\\r\\nWhat will these hands ne're be cleane? No more o'that\\r\\nmy Lord, no more o'that: you marre all with this starting\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Go too, go too:\\r\\nYou haue knowne what you should not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. She ha's spoke what shee should not, I am sure\\r\\nof that: Heauen knowes what she ha's knowne\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Heere's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes\\r\\nof Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.\\r\\nOh, oh, oh\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. What a sigh is there? The hart is sorely charg'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. I would not haue such a heart in my bosome,\\r\\nfor the dignity of the whole body\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Well, well, well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. Pray God it be sir\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. This disease is beyond my practise: yet I haue\\r\\nknowne those which haue walkt in their sleep, who haue\\r\\ndyed holily in their beds\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lad. Wash your hands, put on your Night-Gowne,\\r\\nlooke not so pale: I tell you yet againe Banquo's buried;\\r\\nhe cannot come out on's graue\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Euen so?\\r\\n  Lady.

Will she go now to bed?\\r\\n  Gent. Directly\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Foule whisp'rings are abroad: vnnaturall deeds\\r\\nDo breed vnnaturall troubles: infected mindes\\r\\nTo their deafe pillowes will discharge their Secrets:\\r\\nMore needs she the Diuine, then the Physitian:\\r\\nGod, God forgiue vs all. Looke after her,\\r\\nRemoue from her the meanes of all annoyance,\\r\\nAnd still keepe eyes vpon her: So goodnight,\\r\\nMy minde she ha's mated, and amaz'd my sight.\\r\\nI thinke, but dare not speake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent.

Had I but dy'd an houre before this chance,\\r\\nI had liu'd a blessed time: for from this instant,\\r\\nThere's nothing serious in Mortalitie:\\r\\nAll is but Toyes: Renowne and Grace is dead,\\r\\nThe Wine of Life is drawne, and the meere Lees\\r\\nIs left this Vault, to brag of.\\r\\nEnter Malcolme and Donalbaine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Donal.

Your Royall Father's murther'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Oh, by whom?\\r\\n  Lenox. Those of his Chamber, as it seem'd, had don't:\\r\\nTheir Hands and Faces were all badg'd with blood,\\r\\nSo were their Daggers, which vnwip'd, we found\\r\\nVpon their Pillowes: they star'd, and were distracted,\\r\\nNo mans Life was to be trusted with them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. O, yet I doe repent me of my furie,\\r\\nThat I did kill them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Wherefore did you so?\\r\\n  Macb. Who can be wise, amaz'd, temp'rate, & furious,\\r\\nLoyall, and Neutrall, in a moment? No man:\\r\\nTh' expedition of my violent Loue\\r\\nOut-run the pawser, Reason. Here lay Duncan,\\r\\nHis Siluer skinne, lac'd with His Golden Blood,\\r\\nAnd his gash'd Stabs, look'd like a Breach in Nature,\\r\\nFor Ruines wastfull entrance: there the Murtherers,\\r\\nSteep'd in the Colours of their Trade; their Daggers\\r\\nVnmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refraine,\\r\\nThat had a heart to loue; and in that heart,\\r\\nCourage, to make's loue knowne?\\r\\n  Lady.

Ha, good Father,\\r\\nThou seest the Heauens, as troubled with mans Act,\\r\\nThreatens his bloody Stage: byth' Clock 'tis Day,\\r\\nAnd yet darke Night strangles the trauailing Lampe:\\r\\nIs't Nights predominance, or the Dayes shame,\\r\\nThat Darknesse does the face of Earth intombe,\\r\\nWhen liuing Light should kisse it?\\r\\n  Old man. 'Tis vnnaturall,\\r\\nEuen like the deed that's done: On Tuesday last,\\r\\nA Faulcon towring in her pride of place,\\r\\nWas by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at, and kill'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. And Duncans Horses,\\r\\n(A thing most strange, and certaine)\\r\\nBeauteous, and swift, the Minions of their Race,\\r\\nTurn'd wilde in nature, broke their stalls, flong out,\\r\\nContending 'gainst Obedience, as they would\\r\\nMake Warre with Mankinde\\r\\n\\r\\n   Old man.

Why see you not?\\r\\n  Ross. Is't known who did this more then bloody deed?\\r\\n  Macd. Those that Macbeth hath slaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ross. Alas the day,\\r\\nWhat good could they pretend?\\r\\n  Macd. They were subborned,\\r\\nMalcolme, and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes\\r\\nAre stolne away and fled, which puts vpon them\\r\\nSuspition of the deed\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. 'Gainst Nature still,\\r\\nThriftlesse Ambition, that will rauen vp\\r\\nThine owne liues meanes: Then 'tis most like,\\r\\nThe Soueraignty will fall vpon Macbeth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. He is already nam'd, and gone to Scone\\r\\nTo be inuested\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Where is Duncans body?\\r\\n  Macd. Carried to Colmekill,\\r\\nThe Sacred Store-house of his Predecessors,\\r\\nAnd Guardian of their Bones\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Will you to Scone?\\r\\n  Macd. No Cosin, Ile to Fife\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse.

Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,\\r\\nAs the weyard Women promis'd, and I feare\\r\\nThou playd'st most fowly for't: yet it was saide\\r\\nIt should not stand in thy Posterity,\\r\\nBut that my selfe should be the Roote, and Father\\r\\nOf many Kings. If there come truth from them,\\r\\nAs vpon thee Macbeth, their Speeches shine,\\r\\nWhy by the verities on thee made good,\\r\\nMay they not be my Oracles as well,\\r\\nAnd set me vp in hope. But hush, no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenit sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Lenox, Rosse, Lords,\\r\\nand\\r\\nAttendants.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Heere's our chiefe Guest\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. If he had beene forgotten,\\r\\nIt had bene as a gap in our great Feast,\\r\\nAnd all-thing vnbecomming\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb.

'Tis much he dares,\\r\\nAnd to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde,\\r\\nHe hath a Wisdome, that doth guide his Valour,\\r\\nTo act in safetie. There is none but he,\\r\\nWhose being I doe feare: and vnder him,\\r\\nMy Genius is rebuk'd, as it is said\\r\\nMark Anthonies was by Caesar. He chid the Sisters,\\r\\nWhen first they put the Name of King vpon me,\\r\\nAnd bad them speake to him. Then Prophet-like,\\r\\nThey hayl'd him Father to a Line of Kings.\\r\\nVpon my Head they plac'd a fruitlesse Crowne,\\r\\nAnd put a barren Scepter in my Gripe,\\r\\nThence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand,\\r\\nNo Sonne of mine succeeding: if't be so,\\r\\nFor Banquo's Issue haue I fil'd my Minde,\\r\\nFor them, the gracious Duncan haue I murther'd,\\r\\nPut Rancours in the Vessell of my Peace\\r\\nOnely for them, and mine eternall Iewell\\r\\nGiuen to the common Enemie of Man,\\r\\nTo make them Kings, the Seedes of Banquo Kings.\\r\\nRather then so, come Fate into the Lyst,\\r\\nAnd champion me to th' vtterance.\\r\\nWho's there?\\r\\nEnter Seruant, and two Murtherers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow goe to the Doore, and stay there till we call.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Seruant.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas it not yesterday we spoke together?\\r\\n  Murth.

When all's done\\r\\nYou looke but on a stoole\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Prythee see there:\\r\\nBehold, looke, loe, how say you:\\r\\nWhy what care I, if thou canst nod, speake too.\\r\\nIf Charnell houses, and our Graues must send\\r\\nThose that we bury, backe; our Monuments\\r\\nShall be the Mawes of Kytes\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. What? quite vnmann'd in folly\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. If I stand heere, I saw him\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Fie for shame\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Blood hath bene shed ere now, i'th' olden time\\r\\nEre humane Statute purg'd the gentle Weale:\\r\\nI, and since too, Murthers haue bene perform'd\\r\\nToo terrible for the eare. The times has bene,\\r\\nThat when the Braines were out, the man would dye,\\r\\nAnd there an end: But now they rise againe\\r\\nWith twenty mortall murthers on their crownes,\\r\\nAnd push vs from our stooles. This is more strange\\r\\nThen such a murther is\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. My worthy Lord\\r\\nYour Noble Friends do lacke you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. I do forget:\\r\\nDo not muse at me my most worthy Friends,\\r\\nI haue a strange infirmity, which is nothing\\r\\nTo those that know me. Come, loue and health to all,\\r\\nThen Ile sit downe: Giue me some Wine, fill full:\\r\\nEnter Ghost.\\r\\n\\r\\nI drinke to th' generall ioy o'th' whole Table,\\r\\nAnd to our deere Friend Banquo, whom we misse:\\r\\nWould he were heere: to all, and him we thirst,\\r\\nAnd all to all\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lords.

Thinke of this good Peeres\\r\\nBut as a thing of Custome: 'Tis no other,\\r\\nOnely it spoyles the pleasure of the time\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. What man dare, I dare:\\r\\nApproach thou like the rugged Russian Beare,\\r\\nThe arm'd Rhinoceros, or th' Hircan Tiger,\\r\\nTake any shape but that, and my firme Nerues\\r\\nShall neuer tremble. Or be aliue againe,\\r\\nAnd dare me to the Desart with thy Sword:\\r\\nIf trembling I inhabit then, protest mee\\r\\nThe Baby of a Girle. Hence horrible shadow,\\r\\nVnreall mock'ry hence. Why so, being gone\\r\\nI am a man againe: pray you sit still\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. You haue displac'd the mirth,\\r\\nBroke the good meeting, with most admir'd disorder\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Can such things be,\\r\\nAnd ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd,\\r\\nWithout our speciall wonder? You make me strange\\r\\nEuen to the disposition that I owe,\\r\\nWhen now I thinke you can behold such sights,\\r\\nAnd keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes,\\r\\nWhen mine is blanch'd with feare\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. What sights, my Lord?\\r\\n  La. I pray you speake not: he growes worse & worse\\r\\nQuestion enrages him: at once, goodnight.\\r\\nStand not vpon the order of your going,\\r\\nBut go at once\\r\\n\\r\\n   Len. Good night, and better health\\r\\nAttend his Maiesty\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. A kinde goodnight to all.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Lords.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb.

What is the night?\\r\\n  La. Almost at oddes with morning, which is which\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person\\r\\nAt our great bidding\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Did you send to him Sir?\\r\\n  Macb. I heare it by the way: But I will send:\\r\\nThere's not a one of them but in his house\\r\\nI keepe a Seruant Feed. I will to morrow\\r\\n(And betimes I will) to the weyard Sisters.\\r\\nMore shall they speake: for now I am bent to know\\r\\nBy the worst meanes, the worst, for mine owne good,\\r\\nAll causes shall giue way.

Haue I not reason (Beldams) as you are?\\r\\nSawcy, and ouer-bold, how did you dare\\r\\nTo Trade, and Trafficke with Macbeth,\\r\\nIn Riddles, and Affaires of death;\\r\\nAnd I the Mistris of your Charmes,\\r\\nThe close contriuer of all harmes,\\r\\nWas neuer call'd to beare my part,\\r\\nOr shew the glory of our Art?\\r\\nAnd which is worse, all you haue done\\r\\nHath bene but for a wayward Sonne,\\r\\nSpightfull, and wrathfull, who (as others do)\\r\\nLoues for his owne ends, not for you.\\r\\nBut make amends now: Get you gon,\\r\\nAnd at the pit of Acheron\\r\\nMeete me i'th' Morning: thither he\\r\\nWill come, to know his Destinie.\\r\\nYour Vessels, and your Spels prouide,\\r\\nYour Charmes, and euery thing beside;\\r\\nI am for th' Ayre: This night Ile spend\\r\\nVnto a dismall, and a Fatall end.\\r\\nGreat businesse must be wrought ere Noone.\\r\\nVpon the Corner of the Moone\\r\\nThere hangs a vap'rous drop, profound,\\r\\nIle catch it ere it come to ground;\\r\\nAnd that distill'd by Magicke slights,\\r\\nShall raise such Artificiall Sprights,\\r\\nAs by the strength of their illusion,\\r\\nShall draw him on to his Confusion.\\r\\nHe shall spurne Fate, scorne Death, and beare\\r\\nHis hopes 'boue Wisedome, Grace, and Feare:\\r\\nAnd you all know, Security\\r\\nIs Mortals cheefest Enemie.\\r\\n\\r\\nMusicke, and a Song.\\r\\n\\r\\nHearke, I am call'd: my little Spirit see\\r\\nSits in Foggy cloud, and stayes for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nSing within.

My former Speeches,\\r\\nHaue but hit your Thoughts\\r\\nWhich can interpret farther: Onely I say\\r\\nThings haue bin strangely borne. The gracious Duncan\\r\\nWas pittied of Macbeth: marry he was dead:\\r\\nAnd the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,\\r\\nWhom you may say (if't please you) Fleans kill'd,\\r\\nFor Fleans fled: Men must not walke too late.\\r\\nWho cannot want the thought, how monstrous\\r\\nIt was for Malcolme, and for Donalbane\\r\\nTo kill their gracious Father? Damned Fact,\\r\\nHow it did greeue Macbeth? Did he not straight\\r\\nIn pious rage, the two delinquents teare,\\r\\nThat were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles of sleepe?\\r\\nWas not that Nobly done? I, and wisely too:\\r\\nFor 'twould haue anger'd any heart aliue\\r\\nTo heare the men deny't. So that I say,\\r\\nHe ha's borne all things well, and I do thinke,\\r\\nThat had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key,\\r\\n(As, and't please Heauen he shall not) they should finde\\r\\nWhat 'twere to kill a Father: So should Fleans.\\r\\nBut peace; for from broad words, and cause he fayl'd\\r\\nHis presence at the Tyrants Feast, I heare\\r\\nMacduffe liues in disgrace. Sir, can you tell\\r\\nWhere he bestowes himselfe?\\r\\n  Lord. The Sonnes of Duncane\\r\\n(From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth)\\r\\nLiues in the English Court, and is receyu'd\\r\\nOf the most Pious Edward, with such grace,\\r\\nThat the maleuolence of Fortune, nothing\\r\\nTakes from his high respect. Thither Macduffe\\r\\nIs gone, to pray the Holy King, vpon his ayd\\r\\nTo wake Northumberland, and warlike Seyward,\\r\\nThat by the helpe of these (with him aboue)\\r\\nTo ratifie the Worke) we may againe\\r\\nGiue to our Tables meate, sleepe to our Nights:\\r\\nFree from our Feasts, and Banquets bloody kniues;\\r\\nDo faithfull Homage, and receiue free Honors,\\r\\nAll which we pine for now. And this report\\r\\nHath so exasperate their King, that hee\\r\\nPrepares for some attempt of Warre\\r\\n\\r\\n   Len. Sent he to Macduffe?\\r\\n  Lord. He did: and with an absolute Sir, not I\\r\\nThe clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe,\\r\\nAnd hums; as who should say, you'l rue the time\\r\\nThat clogges me with this Answer\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lenox. And that well might\\r\\nAduise him to a Caution, t' hold what distance\\r\\nHis wisedome can prouide. Some holy Angell\\r\\nFlye to the Court of England, and vnfold\\r\\nHis Message ere he come, that a swift blessing\\r\\nMay soone returne to this our suffering Country,\\r\\nVnder a hand accurs'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lord.

Listen, but speake not too't\\r\\n\\r\\n   3 Appar.

Sweet boadments, good:\\r\\nRebellious dead, rise neuer till the Wood\\r\\nOf Byrnan rise, and our high plac'd Macbeth\\r\\nShall liue the Lease of Nature, pay his breath\\r\\nTo time, and mortall Custome.

I will be satisfied.

You know not\\r\\nWhether it was his wisedome, or his feare\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,\\r\\nHis Mansion, and his Titles, in a place\\r\\nFrom whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,\\r\\nHe wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren\\r\\n(The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,\\r\\nHer yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:\\r\\nAll is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;\\r\\nAs little is the Wisedome, where the flight\\r\\nSo runnes against all reason\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. My deerest Cooz,\\r\\nI pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,\\r\\nHe is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes\\r\\nThe fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,\\r\\nBut cruell are the times, when we are Traitors\\r\\nAnd do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor\\r\\nFrom what we feare, yet know not what we feare,\\r\\nBut floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea\\r\\nEach way, and moue.

Nay how will you do for a Husband?\\r\\n  Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Thou speak'st withall thy wit,\\r\\nAnd yet I'faith with wit enough for thee\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?\\r\\n  Wife. I, that he was\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. What is a Traitor?\\r\\n  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,\\r\\nAnd must be hang'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?\\r\\n  Wife. Euery one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Who must hang them?\\r\\n  Wife. Why, the honest men\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there\\r\\nare Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,\\r\\nand hang vp them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:\\r\\nBut how wilt thou do for a Father?\\r\\n  Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you\\r\\nwould not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely\\r\\nhaue a new Father\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife.

But I remember now\\r\\nI am in this earthly world: where to do harme\\r\\nIs often laudable, to do good sometime\\r\\nAccounted dangerous folly.

But I shall craue your pardon:\\r\\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;\\r\\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell.\\r\\nThough all things foule, would wear the brows of grace\\r\\nYet Grace must still looke so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Perchance euen there\\r\\nWhere I did finde my doubts.\\r\\nWhy in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?\\r\\nThose precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,\\r\\nWithout leaue-taking. I pray you,\\r\\nLet not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,\\r\\nBut mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,\\r\\nWhat euer I shall thinke\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,\\r\\nGreat Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,\\r\\nFor goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,\\r\\nThe Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,\\r\\nI would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,\\r\\nFor the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,\\r\\nAnd the rich East to boot\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Be not offended:\\r\\nI speake not as in absolute feare of you:\\r\\nI thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,\\r\\nIt weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\\r\\nIs added to her wounds. I thinke withall,\\r\\nThere would be hands vplifted in my right:\\r\\nAnd heere from gracious England haue I offer\\r\\nOf goodly thousands. But for all this,\\r\\nWhen I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,\\r\\nOr weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country\\r\\nShall haue more vices then it had before,\\r\\nMore suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,\\r\\nBy him that shall succeede\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What should he be?\\r\\n  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know\\r\\nAll the particulars of Vice so grafted,\\r\\nThat when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth\\r\\nWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State\\r\\nEsteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd\\r\\nWith my confinelesse harmes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Not in the Legions\\r\\nOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd\\r\\nIn euils, to top Macbeth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. I grant him Bloody,\\r\\nLuxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,\\r\\nSodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne\\r\\nThat ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none\\r\\nIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,\\r\\nYour Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp\\r\\nThe Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire\\r\\nAll continent Impediments would ore-beare\\r\\nThat did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,\\r\\nThen such an one to reigne\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Boundlesse intemperance\\r\\nIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene\\r\\nTh' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,\\r\\nAnd fall of many Kings. But feare not yet\\r\\nTo take vpon you what is yours: you may\\r\\nConuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\\r\\nAnd yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:\\r\\nWe haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be\\r\\nThat Vulture in you, to deuoure so many\\r\\nAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,\\r\\nFinding it so inclinde\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. With this, there growes\\r\\nIn my most ill-composd Affection, such\\r\\nA stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,\\r\\nI should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,\\r\\nDesire his Iewels, and this others House,\\r\\nAnd my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce\\r\\nTo make me hunger more, that I should forge\\r\\nQuarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,\\r\\nDestroying them for wealth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. This Auarice\\r\\nstickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote\\r\\nThen Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin\\r\\nThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,\\r\\nScotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will\\r\\nOf your meere Owne. All these are portable,\\r\\nWith other Graces weigh'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,\\r\\nAs Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,\\r\\nBounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,\\r\\nDeuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,\\r\\nI haue no rellish of them, but abound\\r\\nIn the diuision of each seuerall Crime,\\r\\nActing it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should\\r\\nPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,\\r\\nVprore the vniuersall peace, confound\\r\\nAll vnity on earth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:\\r\\nI am as I haue spoken\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!\\r\\nWith an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,\\r\\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?\\r\\nSince that the truest Issue of thy Throne\\r\\nBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,\\r\\nAnd do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father\\r\\nWas a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,\\r\\nOftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,\\r\\nDy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,\\r\\nThese Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,\\r\\nHath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,\\r\\nThy hope ends heere\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion\\r\\nChilde of integrity, hath from my soule\\r\\nWip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts\\r\\nTo thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,\\r\\nBy many of these traines, hath sought to win me\\r\\nInto his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me\\r\\nFrom ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue\\r\\nDeale betweene thee and me; For euen now\\r\\nI put my selfe to thy Direction, and\\r\\nVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure\\r\\nThe taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,\\r\\nFor strangers to my Nature. I am yet\\r\\nVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,\\r\\nScarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.\\r\\nAt no time broke my Faith, would not betray\\r\\nThe Deuill to his Fellow, and delight\\r\\nNo lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking\\r\\nWas this vpon my selfe. What I am truly\\r\\nIs thine, and my poore Countries to command:\\r\\nWhither indeed, before they heere approach\\r\\nOld Seyward with ten thousand warlike men\\r\\nAlready at a point, was setting foorth:\\r\\nNow wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse\\r\\nBe like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?\\r\\n  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once\\r\\n'Tis hard to reconcile.\\r\\nEnter a Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth\\r\\nI pray you?\\r\\n  Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched Soules\\r\\nThat stay his Cure: their malady conuinces\\r\\nThe great assay of Art. But at his touch,\\r\\nSuch sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,\\r\\nThey presently amend.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. I thanke you Doctor\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What's the Disease he meanes?\\r\\n  Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.\\r\\nA most myraculous worke in this good King,\\r\\nWhich often since my heere remaine in England,\\r\\nI haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen\\r\\nHimselfe best knowes: but strangely visited people\\r\\nAll swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,\\r\\nThe meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,\\r\\nHanging a golden stampe about their neckes,\\r\\nPut on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken\\r\\nTo the succeeding Royalty he leaues\\r\\nThe healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,\\r\\nHe hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,\\r\\nAnd sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,\\r\\nThat speake him full of Grace.\\r\\nEnter Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macd. See who comes heere\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue\\r\\nThe meanes that makes vs Strangers\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Sir, Amen\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?\\r\\n  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,\\r\\nAlmost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot\\r\\nBe call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing\\r\\nBut who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:\\r\\nWhere sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre\\r\\nAre made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes\\r\\nA Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,\\r\\nIs there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues\\r\\nExpire before the Flowers in their Caps,\\r\\nDying, or ere they sicken\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. What's the newest griefe?\\r\\n  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,\\r\\nEach minute teemes a new one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. How do's my Wife?\\r\\n  Rosse. Why well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And all my Children?\\r\\n  Rosse. Well too\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace?\\r\\n  Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em\\r\\n  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?\\r\\n  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings\\r\\nWhich I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour\\r\\nOf many worthy Fellowes, that were out,\\r\\nWhich was to my beleefe witnest the rather,\\r\\nFor that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.\\r\\nNow is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland\\r\\nWould create Soldiours, make our women fight,\\r\\nTo doffe their dire distresses\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Bee't their comfort\\r\\nWe are comming thither: Gracious England hath\\r\\nLent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,\\r\\nAn older, and a better Souldier, none\\r\\nThat Christendome giues out\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Would I could answer\\r\\nThis comfort with the like. But I haue words\\r\\nThat would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,\\r\\nWhere hearing should not latch them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What concerne they,\\r\\nThe generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe\\r\\nDue to some single brest?\\r\\n  Rosse. No minde that's honest\\r\\nBut in it shares some woe, though the maine part\\r\\nPertaines to you alone\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. If it be mine\\r\\nKeepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,\\r\\nWhich shall possesse them with the heauiest sound\\r\\nthat euer yet they heard\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Humh: I guesse at it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes\\r\\nSauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner\\r\\nWere on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere\\r\\nTo adde the death of you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Mercifull Heauen:\\r\\nWhat man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:\\r\\nGiue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,\\r\\nWhispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. My Children too?\\r\\n  Ro. Wife, Children, Seruants, all that could be found\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And I must be from thence? My wife kil'd too?\\r\\n  Rosse. I haue said\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Be comforted.\\r\\nLet's make vs Med'cines of our great Reuenge,\\r\\nTo cure this deadly greefe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. He ha's no Children. All my pretty ones?\\r\\nDid you say All? Oh Hell-Kite! All?\\r\\nWhat, All my pretty Chickens, and their Damme\\r\\nAt one fell swoope?\\r\\n  Malc. Dispute it like a man\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I shall do so:\\r\\nBut I must also feele it as a man;\\r\\nI cannot but remember such things were\\r\\nThat were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,\\r\\nAnd would not take their part? Sinfull Macduff,\\r\\nThey were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,\\r\\nNot for their owne demerits, but for mine\\r\\nFell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefe\\r\\nConuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O I could play the woman with mine eyes,\\r\\nAnd Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,\\r\\nCut short all intermission: Front to Front,\\r\\nBring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfe\\r\\nWithin my Swords length set him, if he scape\\r\\nHeauen forgiue him too\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. This time goes manly:\\r\\nCome go we to the King, our Power is ready,\\r\\nOur lacke is nothing but our leaue. Macbeth\\r\\nIs ripe for shaking, and the Powres aboue\\r\\nPut on their Instruments: Receiue what cheere you may,\\r\\nThe Night is long, that neuer findes the Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nActus Quintus. Scena Prima.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter a Doctor of Physicke, and a Wayting Gentlewoman.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Doct. I haue too Nights watch'd with you, but can\\r\\nperceiue no truth in your report. When was it shee last\\r\\nwalk'd?\\r\\n  Gent. Since his Maiesty went into the Field, I haue\\r\\nseene her rise from her bed, throw her Night-Gown vppon\\r\\nher, vnlocke her Closset, take foorth paper, folde it,\\r\\nwrite vpon't, read it, afterwards Seale it, and againe returne\\r\\nto bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. A great perturbation in Nature, to receyue at\\r\\nonce the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching.\\r\\nIn this slumbry agitation, besides her walking, and other\\r\\nactuall performances, what (at any time) haue you heard\\r\\nher say?\\r\\n  Gent. That Sir, which I will not report after her\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent.

Fye, my Lord, fie,\\r\\na Souldier, and affear'd? what need we feare? who knowes\\r\\nit, when none can call our powre to accompt: yet who\\r\\nwould haue thought the olde man to haue had so much\\r\\nblood in him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Do you marke that?\\r\\n  Lad. The Thane of Fife, had a wife: where is she now?\\r\\nWhat will these hands ne're be cleane? No more o'that\\r\\nmy Lord, no more o'that: you marre all with this starting\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Go too, go too:\\r\\nYou haue knowne what you should not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. She ha's spoke what shee should not, I am sure\\r\\nof that: Heauen knowes what she ha's knowne\\r\\n\\r\\n   La.

The hart is sorely charg'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. I would not haue such a heart in my bosome,\\r\\nfor the dignity of the whole body\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Well, well, well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent.

Wash your hands, put on your Night-Gowne,\\r\\nlooke not so pale: I tell you yet againe Banquo's buried;\\r\\nhe cannot come out on's graue\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Euen so?\\r\\n  Lady.

My Lord his throat is cut, that I did for him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. Thou art the best o'th' Cut-throats,\\r\\nYet hee's good that did the like for Fleans:\\r\\nIf thou did'st it, thou art the Non-pareill\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mur. Most Royall Sir\\r\\nFleans is scap'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Then comes my Fit againe:\\r\\nI had else beene perfect;\\r\\nWhole as the Marble, founded as the Rocke,\\r\\nAs broad, and generall, as the casing Ayre:\\r\\nBut now I am cabin'd, crib'd, confin'd, bound in\\r\\nTo sawcy doubts, and feares. But Banquo's safe?\\r\\n  Mur. I, my good Lord: safe in a ditch he bides,\\r\\nWith twenty trenched gashes on his head;\\r\\nThe least a Death to Nature\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Thankes for that:\\r\\nThere the growne Serpent lyes, the worme that's fled\\r\\nHath Nature that in time will Venom breed,\\r\\nNo teeth for th' present. Get thee gone, to morrow\\r\\nWee'l heare our selues againe.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Murderer.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. My Royall Lord,\\r\\nYou do not giue the Cheere, the Feast is sold\\r\\nThat is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a making:\\r\\n'Tis giuen, with welcome: to feede were best at home:\\r\\nFrom thence, the sawce to meate is Ceremony,\\r\\nMeeting were bare without it.\\r\\nEnter the Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macbeths place.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Sweet Remembrancer:\\r\\nNow good digestion waite on Appetite,\\r\\nAnd health on both\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lenox. May't please your Highnesse sit\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Here had we now our Countries Honor, roof'd,\\r\\nWere the grac'd person of our Banquo present:\\r\\nWho, may I rather challenge for vnkindnesse,\\r\\nThen pitty for Mischance\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. His absence (Sir)\\r\\nLayes blame vpon his promise. Pleas't your Highnesse\\r\\nTo grace vs with your Royall Company?\\r\\n  Macb. The Table's full\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lenox. Heere is a place reseru'd Sir\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Where?\\r\\n  Lenox. Heere my good Lord.\\r\\nWhat is't that moues your Highnesse?\\r\\n  Macb. Which of you haue done this?\\r\\n  Lords. What, my good Lord?\\r\\n  Macb. Thou canst not say I did it: neuer shake\\r\\nThy goary lockes at me\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Gentlemen rise, his Highnesse is not well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. Sit worthy Friends: my Lord is often thus,\\r\\nAnd hath beene from his youth. Pray you keepe Seat,\\r\\nThe fit is momentary, vpon a thought\\r\\nHe will againe be well. If much you note him\\r\\nYou shall offend him, and extend his Passion,\\r\\nFeed, and regard him not. Are you a man?\\r\\n  Macb. I, and a bold one, that dare looke on that\\r\\nWhich might appall the Diuell\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. O proper stuffe:\\r\\nThis is the very painting of your feare:\\r\\nThis is the Ayre-drawne-Dagger which you said\\r\\nLed you to Duncan. O, these flawes and starts\\r\\n(Impostors to true feare) would well become\\r\\nA womans story, at a Winters fire\\r\\nAuthoriz'd by her Grandam: shame it selfe,\\r\\nWhy do you make such faces? When all's done\\r\\nYou looke but on a stoole\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Prythee see there:\\r\\nBehold, looke, loe, how say you:\\r\\nWhy what care I, if thou canst nod, speake too.\\r\\nIf Charnell houses, and our Graues must send\\r\\nThose that we bury, backe; our Monuments\\r\\nShall be the Mawes of Kytes\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. What? quite vnmann'd in folly\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. If I stand heere, I saw him\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Fie for shame\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Blood hath bene shed ere now, i'th' olden time\\r\\nEre humane Statute purg'd the gentle Weale:\\r\\nI, and since too, Murthers haue bene perform'd\\r\\nToo terrible for the eare. The times has bene,\\r\\nThat when the Braines were out, the man would dye,\\r\\nAnd there an end: But now they rise againe\\r\\nWith twenty mortall murthers on their crownes,\\r\\nAnd push vs from our stooles. This is more strange\\r\\nThen such a murther is\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. My worthy Lord\\r\\nYour Noble Friends do lacke you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. I do forget:\\r\\nDo not muse at me my most worthy Friends,\\r\\nI haue a strange infirmity, which is nothing\\r\\nTo those that know me. Come, loue and health to all,\\r\\nThen Ile sit downe: Giue me some Wine, fill full:\\r\\nEnter Ghost.\\r\\n\\r\\nI drinke to th' generall ioy o'th' whole Table,\\r\\nAnd to our deere Friend Banquo, whom we misse:\\r\\nWould he were heere: to all, and him we thirst,\\r\\nAnd all to all\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lords. Our duties, and the pledge\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. Auant, & quit my sight, let the earth hide thee:\\r\\nThy bones are marrowlesse, thy blood is cold:\\r\\nThou hast no speculation in those eyes\\r\\nWhich thou dost glare with\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Thinke of this good Peeres\\r\\nBut as a thing of Custome: 'Tis no other,\\r\\nOnely it spoyles the pleasure of the time\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. What man dare, I dare:\\r\\nApproach thou like the rugged Russian Beare,\\r\\nThe arm'd Rhinoceros, or th' Hircan Tiger,\\r\\nTake any shape but that, and my firme Nerues\\r\\nShall neuer tremble. Or be aliue againe,\\r\\nAnd dare me to the Desart with thy Sword:\\r\\nIf trembling I inhabit then, protest mee\\r\\nThe Baby of a Girle. Hence horrible shadow,\\r\\nVnreall mock'ry hence. Why so, being gone\\r\\nI am a man againe: pray you sit still\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. You haue displac'd the mirth,\\r\\nBroke the good meeting, with most admir'd disorder\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Can such things be,\\r\\nAnd ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd,\\r\\nWithout our speciall wonder? You make me strange\\r\\nEuen to the disposition that I owe,\\r\\nWhen now I thinke you can behold such sights,\\r\\nAnd keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes,\\r\\nWhen mine is blanch'd with feare\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. What sights, my Lord?\\r\\n  La. I pray you speake not: he growes worse & worse\\r\\nQuestion enrages him: at once, goodnight.\\r\\nStand not vpon the order of your going,\\r\\nBut go at once\\r\\n\\r\\n   Len. Good night, and better health\\r\\nAttend his Maiesty\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. A kinde goodnight to all.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Lords.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. It will haue blood they say:\\r\\nBlood will haue Blood:\\r\\nStones haue beene knowne to moue, & Trees to speake:\\r\\nAugures, and vnderstood Relations, haue\\r\\nBy Maggot Pyes, & Choughes, & Rookes brought forth\\r\\nThe secret'st man of Blood. What is the night?\\r\\n  La. Almost at oddes with morning, which is which\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person\\r\\nAt our great bidding\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Did you send to him Sir?\\r\\n  Macb. I heare it by the way: But I will send:\\r\\nThere's not a one of them but in his house\\r\\nI keepe a Seruant Feed. I will to morrow\\r\\n(And betimes I will) to the weyard Sisters.\\r\\nMore shall they speake: for now I am bent to know\\r\\nBy the worst meanes, the worst, for mine owne good,\\r\\nAll causes shall giue way.

You lacke the season of all Natures, sleepe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Come, wee'l to sleepe: My strange & self-abuse\\r\\nIs the initiate feare, that wants hard vse:\\r\\nWe are yet but yong indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScena Quinta.\\r\\n\\r\\nThunder.

Haue I not reason (Beldams) as you are?\\r\\nSawcy, and ouer-bold, how did you dare\\r\\nTo Trade, and Trafficke with Macbeth,\\r\\nIn Riddles, and Affaires of death;\\r\\nAnd I the Mistris of your Charmes,\\r\\nThe close contriuer of all harmes,\\r\\nWas neuer call'd to beare my part,\\r\\nOr shew the glory of our Art?\\r\\nAnd which is worse, all you haue done\\r\\nHath bene but for a wayward Sonne,\\r\\nSpightfull, and wrathfull, who (as others do)\\r\\nLoues for his owne ends, not for you.\\r\\nBut make amends now: Get you gon,\\r\\nAnd at the pit of Acheron\\r\\nMeete me i'th' Morning: thither he\\r\\nWill come, to know his Destinie.\\r\\nYour Vessels, and your Spels prouide,\\r\\nYour Charmes, and euery thing beside;\\r\\nI am for th' Ayre: This night Ile spend\\r\\nVnto a dismall, and a Fatall end.\\r\\nGreat businesse must be wrought ere Noone.\\r\\nVpon the Corner of the Moone\\r\\nThere hangs a vap'rous drop, profound,\\r\\nIle catch it ere it come to ground;\\r\\nAnd that distill'd by Magicke slights,\\r\\nShall raise such Artificiall Sprights,\\r\\nAs by the strength of their illusion,\\r\\nShall draw him on to his Confusion.\\r\\nHe shall spurne Fate, scorne Death, and beare\\r\\nHis hopes 'boue Wisedome, Grace, and Feare:\\r\\nAnd you all know, Security\\r\\nIs Mortals cheefest Enemie.\\r\\n\\r\\nMusicke, and a Song.\\r\\n\\r\\nHearke, I am call'd: my little Spirit see\\r\\nSits in Foggy cloud, and stayes for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nSing within.

My former Speeches,\\r\\nHaue but hit your Thoughts\\r\\nWhich can interpret farther: Onely I say\\r\\nThings haue bin strangely borne. The gracious Duncan\\r\\nWas pittied of Macbeth: marry he was dead:\\r\\nAnd the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,\\r\\nWhom you may say (if't please you) Fleans kill'd,\\r\\nFor Fleans fled: Men must not walke too late.\\r\\nWho cannot want the thought, how monstrous\\r\\nIt was for Malcolme, and for Donalbane\\r\\nTo kill their gracious Father? Damned Fact,\\r\\nHow it did greeue Macbeth? Did he not straight\\r\\nIn pious rage, the two delinquents teare,\\r\\nThat were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles of sleepe?\\r\\nWas not that Nobly done? I, and wisely too:\\r\\nFor 'twould haue anger'd any heart aliue\\r\\nTo heare the men deny't. So that I say,\\r\\nHe ha's borne all things well, and I do thinke,\\r\\nThat had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key,\\r\\n(As, and't please Heauen he shall not) they should finde\\r\\nWhat 'twere to kill a Father: So should Fleans.\\r\\nBut peace; for from broad words, and cause he fayl'd\\r\\nHis presence at the Tyrants Feast, I heare\\r\\nMacduffe liues in disgrace. Sir, can you tell\\r\\nWhere he bestowes himselfe?\\r\\n  Lord. The Sonnes of Duncane\\r\\n(From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth)\\r\\nLiues in the English Court, and is receyu'd\\r\\nOf the most Pious Edward, with such grace,\\r\\nThat the maleuolence of Fortune, nothing\\r\\nTakes from his high respect. Thither Macduffe\\r\\nIs gone, to pray the Holy King, vpon his ayd\\r\\nTo wake Northumberland, and warlike Seyward,\\r\\nThat by the helpe of these (with him aboue)\\r\\nTo ratifie the Worke) we may againe\\r\\nGiue to our Tables meate, sleepe to our Nights:\\r\\nFree from our Feasts, and Banquets bloody kniues;\\r\\nDo faithfull Homage, and receiue free Honors,\\r\\nAll which we pine for now. And this report\\r\\nHath so exasperate their King, that hee\\r\\nPrepares for some attempt of Warre\\r\\n\\r\\n   Len. Sent he to Macduffe?\\r\\n  Lord. He did: and with an absolute Sir, not I\\r\\nThe clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe,\\r\\nAnd hums; as who should say, you'l rue the time\\r\\nThat clogges me with this Answer\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lenox. And that well might\\r\\nAduise him to a Caution, t' hold what distance\\r\\nHis wisedome can prouide. Some holy Angell\\r\\nFlye to the Court of England, and vnfold\\r\\nHis Message ere he come, that a swift blessing\\r\\nMay soone returne to this our suffering Country,\\r\\nVnder a hand accurs'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lord.

I will be satisfied.

You know not\\r\\nWhether it was his wisedome, or his feare\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,\\r\\nHis Mansion, and his Titles, in a place\\r\\nFrom whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,\\r\\nHe wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren\\r\\n(The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,\\r\\nHer yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:\\r\\nAll is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;\\r\\nAs little is the Wisedome, where the flight\\r\\nSo runnes against all reason\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. My deerest Cooz,\\r\\nI pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,\\r\\nHe is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes\\r\\nThe fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,\\r\\nBut cruell are the times, when we are Traitors\\r\\nAnd do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor\\r\\nFrom what we feare, yet know not what we feare,\\r\\nBut floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea\\r\\nEach way, and moue.

What is a Traitor?\\r\\n  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,\\r\\nAnd must be hang'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?\\r\\n  Wife. Euery one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Who must hang them?\\r\\n  Wife. Why, the honest men\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there\\r\\nare Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,\\r\\nand hang vp them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:\\r\\nBut how wilt thou do for a Father?\\r\\n  Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you\\r\\nwould not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely\\r\\nhaue a new Father\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?\\r\\nEnter a Messenger.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mes. Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,\\r\\nThough in your state of Honor I am perfect;\\r\\nI doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.\\r\\nIf you will take a homely mans aduice,\\r\\nBe not found heere: Hence with your little ones\\r\\nTo fright you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:\\r\\nTo do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,\\r\\nWhich is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,\\r\\nI dare abide no longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Messenger\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. Whether should I flye?\\r\\nI haue done no harme. But I remember now\\r\\nI am in this earthly world: where to do harme\\r\\nIs often laudable, to do good sometime\\r\\nAccounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)\\r\\nDo I put vp that womanly defence,\\r\\nTo say I haue done no harme?\\r\\nWhat are these faces?\\r\\nEnter Murtherers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mur. Where is your Husband?\\r\\n  Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,\\r\\nWhere such as thou may'st finde him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mur. He's a Traitor\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd Villaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mur. What you Egge?\\r\\nYong fry of Treachery?\\r\\n  Son. He ha's kill'd me Mother,\\r\\nRun away I pray you.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit crying Murther.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScaena Tertia.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Malcolme and Macduffe.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there\\r\\nWeepe our sad bosomes empty\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Let vs rather\\r\\nHold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,\\r\\nBestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,\\r\\nNew Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes\\r\\nStrike heauen on the face, that it resounds\\r\\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out\\r\\nLike Syllable of Dolour\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;\\r\\nWhat know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,\\r\\nAs I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.\\r\\nWhat you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.\\r\\nThis Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\\r\\nWas once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,\\r\\nHe hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something\\r\\nYou may discerne of him through me, and wisedome\\r\\nTo offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe\\r\\nT' appease an angry God\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I am not treacherous\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. But Macbeth is.\\r\\nA good and vertuous Nature may recoyle\\r\\nIn an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:\\r\\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;\\r\\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell.\\r\\nThough all things foule, would wear the brows of grace\\r\\nYet Grace must still looke so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Perchance euen there\\r\\nWhere I did finde my doubts.\\r\\nWhy in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?\\r\\nThose precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,\\r\\nWithout leaue-taking. I pray you,\\r\\nLet not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,\\r\\nBut mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,\\r\\nWhat euer I shall thinke\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,\\r\\nGreat Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,\\r\\nFor goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,\\r\\nThe Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,\\r\\nI would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,\\r\\nFor the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,\\r\\nAnd the rich East to boot\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Be not offended:\\r\\nI speake not as in absolute feare of you:\\r\\nI thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,\\r\\nIt weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\\r\\nIs added to her wounds. I thinke withall,\\r\\nThere would be hands vplifted in my right:\\r\\nAnd heere from gracious England haue I offer\\r\\nOf goodly thousands. But for all this,\\r\\nWhen I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,\\r\\nOr weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country\\r\\nShall haue more vices then it had before,\\r\\nMore suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,\\r\\nBy him that shall succeede\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What should he be?\\r\\n  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know\\r\\nAll the particulars of Vice so grafted,\\r\\nThat when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth\\r\\nWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State\\r\\nEsteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd\\r\\nWith my confinelesse harmes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Not in the Legions\\r\\nOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd\\r\\nIn euils, to top Macbeth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. I grant him Bloody,\\r\\nLuxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,\\r\\nSodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne\\r\\nThat ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none\\r\\nIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,\\r\\nYour Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp\\r\\nThe Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire\\r\\nAll continent Impediments would ore-beare\\r\\nThat did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,\\r\\nThen such an one to reigne\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Boundlesse intemperance\\r\\nIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene\\r\\nTh' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,\\r\\nAnd fall of many Kings. But feare not yet\\r\\nTo take vpon you what is yours: you may\\r\\nConuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\\r\\nAnd yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:\\r\\nWe haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be\\r\\nThat Vulture in you, to deuoure so many\\r\\nAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,\\r\\nFinding it so inclinde\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. With this, there growes\\r\\nIn my most ill-composd Affection, such\\r\\nA stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,\\r\\nI should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,\\r\\nDesire his Iewels, and this others House,\\r\\nAnd my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce\\r\\nTo make me hunger more, that I should forge\\r\\nQuarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,\\r\\nDestroying them for wealth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. This Auarice\\r\\nstickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote\\r\\nThen Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin\\r\\nThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,\\r\\nScotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will\\r\\nOf your meere Owne. All these are portable,\\r\\nWith other Graces weigh'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,\\r\\nAs Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,\\r\\nBounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,\\r\\nDeuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,\\r\\nI haue no rellish of them, but abound\\r\\nIn the diuision of each seuerall Crime,\\r\\nActing it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should\\r\\nPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,\\r\\nVprore the vniuersall peace, confound\\r\\nAll vnity on earth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:\\r\\nI am as I haue spoken\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!\\r\\nWith an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,\\r\\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?\\r\\nSince that the truest Issue of thy Throne\\r\\nBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,\\r\\nAnd do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father\\r\\nWas a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,\\r\\nOftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,\\r\\nDy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,\\r\\nThese Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,\\r\\nHath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,\\r\\nThy hope ends heere\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion\\r\\nChilde of integrity, hath from my soule\\r\\nWip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts\\r\\nTo thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,\\r\\nBy many of these traines, hath sought to win me\\r\\nInto his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me\\r\\nFrom ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue\\r\\nDeale betweene thee and me; For euen now\\r\\nI put my selfe to thy Direction, and\\r\\nVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure\\r\\nThe taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,\\r\\nFor strangers to my Nature. I am yet\\r\\nVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,\\r\\nScarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.\\r\\nAt no time broke my Faith, would not betray\\r\\nThe Deuill to his Fellow, and delight\\r\\nNo lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking\\r\\nWas this vpon my selfe. What I am truly\\r\\nIs thine, and my poore Countries to command:\\r\\nWhither indeed, before they heere approach\\r\\nOld Seyward with ten thousand warlike men\\r\\nAlready at a point, was setting foorth:\\r\\nNow wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse\\r\\nBe like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?\\r\\n  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once\\r\\n'Tis hard to reconcile.\\r\\nEnter a Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth\\r\\nI pray you?\\r\\n  Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched Soules\\r\\nThat stay his Cure: their malady conuinces\\r\\nThe great assay of Art. But at his touch,\\r\\nSuch sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,\\r\\nThey presently amend.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. I thanke you Doctor\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What's the Disease he meanes?\\r\\n  Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.\\r\\nA most myraculous worke in this good King,\\r\\nWhich often since my heere remaine in England,\\r\\nI haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen\\r\\nHimselfe best knowes: but strangely visited people\\r\\nAll swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,\\r\\nThe meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,\\r\\nHanging a golden stampe about their neckes,\\r\\nPut on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken\\r\\nTo the succeeding Royalty he leaues\\r\\nThe healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,\\r\\nHe hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,\\r\\nAnd sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,\\r\\nThat speake him full of Grace.\\r\\nEnter Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macd. See who comes heere\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue\\r\\nThe meanes that makes vs Strangers\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Sir, Amen\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?\\r\\n  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,\\r\\nAlmost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot\\r\\nBe call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing\\r\\nBut who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:\\r\\nWhere sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre\\r\\nAre made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes\\r\\nA Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,\\r\\nIs there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues\\r\\nExpire before the Flowers in their Caps,\\r\\nDying, or ere they sicken\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. What's the newest griefe?\\r\\n  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,\\r\\nEach minute teemes a new one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. How do's my Wife?\\r\\n  Rosse. Why well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And all my Children?\\r\\n  Rosse. Well too\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace?\\r\\n  Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em\\r\\n  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?\\r\\n  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings\\r\\nWhich I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour\\r\\nOf many worthy Fellowes, that were out,\\r\\nWhich was to my beleefe witnest the rather,\\r\\nFor that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.\\r\\nNow is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland\\r\\nWould create Soldiours, make our women fight,\\r\\nTo doffe their dire distresses\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Bee't their comfort\\r\\nWe are comming thither: Gracious England hath\\r\\nLent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,\\r\\nAn older, and a better Souldier, none\\r\\nThat Christendome giues out\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Would I could answer\\r\\nThis comfort with the like. But I haue words\\r\\nThat would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,\\r\\nWhere hearing should not latch them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What concerne they,\\r\\nThe generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe\\r\\nDue to some single brest?\\r\\n  Rosse. No minde that's honest\\r\\nBut in it shares some woe, though the maine part\\r\\nPertaines to you alone\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. If it be mine\\r\\nKeepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,\\r\\nWhich shall possesse them with the heauiest sound\\r\\nthat euer yet they heard\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Humh: I guesse at it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes\\r\\nSauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner\\r\\nWere on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere\\r\\nTo adde the death of you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Mercifull Heauen:\\r\\nWhat man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:\\r\\nGiue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,\\r\\nWhispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. My Children too?\\r\\n  Ro. Wife, Children, Seruants, all that could be found\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And I must be from thence? My wife kil'd too?\\r\\n  Rosse. I haue said\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Be comforted.\\r\\nLet's make vs Med'cines of our great Reuenge,\\r\\nTo cure this deadly greefe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. He ha's no Children. All my pretty ones?\\r\\nDid you say All? Oh Hell-Kite! All?\\r\\nWhat, All my pretty Chickens, and their Damme\\r\\nAt one fell swoope?\\r\\n  Malc. Dispute it like a man\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I shall do so:\\r\\nBut I must also feele it as a man;\\r\\nI cannot but remember such things were\\r\\nThat were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,\\r\\nAnd would not take their part? Sinfull Macduff,\\r\\nThey were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,\\r\\nNot for their owne demerits, but for mine\\r\\nFell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefe\\r\\nConuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O I could play the woman with mine eyes,\\r\\nAnd Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,\\r\\nCut short all intermission: Front to Front,\\r\\nBring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfe\\r\\nWithin my Swords length set him, if he scape\\r\\nHeauen forgiue him too\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. This time goes manly:\\r\\nCome go we to the King, our Power is ready,\\r\\nOur lacke is nothing but our leaue. Macbeth\\r\\nIs ripe for shaking, and the Powres aboue\\r\\nPut on their Instruments: Receiue what cheere you may,\\r\\nThe Night is long, that neuer findes the Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nActus Quintus. Scena Prima.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter a Doctor of Physicke, and a Wayting Gentlewoman.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Doct. I haue too Nights watch'd with you, but can\\r\\nperceiue no truth in your report. When was it shee last\\r\\nwalk'd?\\r\\n  Gent. Since his Maiesty went into the Field, I haue\\r\\nseene her rise from her bed, throw her Night-Gown vppon\\r\\nher, vnlocke her Closset, take foorth paper, folde it,\\r\\nwrite vpon't, read it, afterwards Seale it, and againe returne\\r\\nto bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. A great perturbation in Nature, to receyue at\\r\\nonce the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching.\\r\\nIn this slumbry agitation, besides her walking, and other\\r\\nactuall performances, what (at any time) haue you heard\\r\\nher say?\\r\\n  Gent.

Fye, my Lord, fie,\\r\\na Souldier, and affear'd? what need we feare? who knowes\\r\\nit, when none can call our powre to accompt: yet who\\r\\nwould haue thought the olde man to haue had so much\\r\\nblood in him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct.

She ha's spoke what shee should not, I am sure\\r\\nof that: Heauen knowes what she ha's knowne\\r\\n\\r\\n   La.

Nay how will you do for a Husband?\\r\\n  Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Thou speak'st withall thy wit,\\r\\nAnd yet I'faith with wit enough for thee\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?\\r\\n  Wife. I, that he was\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. What is a Traitor?\\r\\n  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,\\r\\nAnd must be hang'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?\\r\\n  Wife. Euery one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Who must hang them?\\r\\n  Wife. Why, the honest men\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there\\r\\nare Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,\\r\\nand hang vp them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:\\r\\nBut how wilt thou do for a Father?\\r\\n  Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you\\r\\nwould not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely\\r\\nhaue a new Father\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?\\r\\nEnter a Messenger.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mes. Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,\\r\\nThough in your state of Honor I am perfect;\\r\\nI doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.\\r\\nIf you will take a homely mans aduice,\\r\\nBe not found heere: Hence with your little ones\\r\\nTo fright you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:\\r\\nTo do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,\\r\\nWhich is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,\\r\\nI dare abide no longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Messenger\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. Whether should I flye?\\r\\nI haue done no harme. But I remember now\\r\\nI am in this earthly world: where to do harme\\r\\nIs often laudable, to do good sometime\\r\\nAccounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)\\r\\nDo I put vp that womanly defence,\\r\\nTo say I haue done no harme?\\r\\nWhat are these faces?\\r\\nEnter Murtherers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mur. Where is your Husband?\\r\\n  Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,\\r\\nWhere such as thou may'st finde him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mur. He's a Traitor\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd Villaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mur. What you Egge?\\r\\nYong fry of Treachery?\\r\\n  Son. He ha's kill'd me Mother,\\r\\nRun away I pray you.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit crying Murther.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScaena Tertia.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Malcolme and Macduffe.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there\\r\\nWeepe our sad bosomes empty\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Let vs rather\\r\\nHold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,\\r\\nBestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,\\r\\nNew Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes\\r\\nStrike heauen on the face, that it resounds\\r\\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out\\r\\nLike Syllable of Dolour\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;\\r\\nWhat know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,\\r\\nAs I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.\\r\\nWhat you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.\\r\\nThis Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\\r\\nWas once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,\\r\\nHe hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something\\r\\nYou may discerne of him through me, and wisedome\\r\\nTo offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe\\r\\nT' appease an angry God\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I am not treacherous\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. But Macbeth is.\\r\\nA good and vertuous Nature may recoyle\\r\\nIn an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:\\r\\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;\\r\\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell.\\r\\nThough all things foule, would wear the brows of grace\\r\\nYet Grace must still looke so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Perchance euen there\\r\\nWhere I did finde my doubts.\\r\\nWhy in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?\\r\\nThose precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,\\r\\nWithout leaue-taking. I pray you,\\r\\nLet not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,\\r\\nBut mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,\\r\\nWhat euer I shall thinke\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,\\r\\nGreat Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,\\r\\nFor goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,\\r\\nThe Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,\\r\\nI would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,\\r\\nFor the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,\\r\\nAnd the rich East to boot\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Be not offended:\\r\\nI speake not as in absolute feare of you:\\r\\nI thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,\\r\\nIt weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\\r\\nIs added to her wounds. I thinke withall,\\r\\nThere would be hands vplifted in my right:\\r\\nAnd heere from gracious England haue I offer\\r\\nOf goodly thousands. But for all this,\\r\\nWhen I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,\\r\\nOr weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country\\r\\nShall haue more vices then it had before,\\r\\nMore suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,\\r\\nBy him that shall succeede\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What should he be?\\r\\n  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know\\r\\nAll the particulars of Vice so grafted,\\r\\nThat when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth\\r\\nWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State\\r\\nEsteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd\\r\\nWith my confinelesse harmes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Not in the Legions\\r\\nOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd\\r\\nIn euils, to top Macbeth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. I grant him Bloody,\\r\\nLuxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,\\r\\nSodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne\\r\\nThat ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none\\r\\nIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,\\r\\nYour Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp\\r\\nThe Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire\\r\\nAll continent Impediments would ore-beare\\r\\nThat did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,\\r\\nThen such an one to reigne\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Boundlesse intemperance\\r\\nIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene\\r\\nTh' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,\\r\\nAnd fall of many Kings. But feare not yet\\r\\nTo take vpon you what is yours: you may\\r\\nConuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\\r\\nAnd yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:\\r\\nWe haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be\\r\\nThat Vulture in you, to deuoure so many\\r\\nAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,\\r\\nFinding it so inclinde\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. With this, there growes\\r\\nIn my most ill-composd Affection, such\\r\\nA stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,\\r\\nI should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,\\r\\nDesire his Iewels, and this others House,\\r\\nAnd my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce\\r\\nTo make me hunger more, that I should forge\\r\\nQuarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,\\r\\nDestroying them for wealth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. This Auarice\\r\\nstickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote\\r\\nThen Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin\\r\\nThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,\\r\\nScotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will\\r\\nOf your meere Owne. All these are portable,\\r\\nWith other Graces weigh'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,\\r\\nAs Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,\\r\\nBounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,\\r\\nDeuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,\\r\\nI haue no rellish of them, but abound\\r\\nIn the diuision of each seuerall Crime,\\r\\nActing it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should\\r\\nPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,\\r\\nVprore the vniuersall peace, confound\\r\\nAll vnity on earth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:\\r\\nI am as I haue spoken\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!\\r\\nWith an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,\\r\\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?\\r\\nSince that the truest Issue of thy Throne\\r\\nBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,\\r\\nAnd do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father\\r\\nWas a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,\\r\\nOftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,\\r\\nDy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,\\r\\nThese Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,\\r\\nHath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,\\r\\nThy hope ends heere\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion\\r\\nChilde of integrity, hath from my soule\\r\\nWip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts\\r\\nTo thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,\\r\\nBy many of these traines, hath sought to win me\\r\\nInto his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me\\r\\nFrom ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue\\r\\nDeale betweene thee and me; For euen now\\r\\nI put my selfe to thy Direction, and\\r\\nVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure\\r\\nThe taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,\\r\\nFor strangers to my Nature. I am yet\\r\\nVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,\\r\\nScarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.\\r\\nAt no time broke my Faith, would not betray\\r\\nThe Deuill to his Fellow, and delight\\r\\nNo lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking\\r\\nWas this vpon my selfe. What I am truly\\r\\nIs thine, and my poore Countries to command:\\r\\nWhither indeed, before they heere approach\\r\\nOld Seyward with ten thousand warlike men\\r\\nAlready at a point, was setting foorth:\\r\\nNow wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse\\r\\nBe like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?\\r\\n  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once\\r\\n'Tis hard to reconcile.\\r\\nEnter a Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth\\r\\nI pray you?\\r\\n  Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched Soules\\r\\nThat stay his Cure: their malady conuinces\\r\\nThe great assay of Art. But at his touch,\\r\\nSuch sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,\\r\\nThey presently amend.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. I thanke you Doctor\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What's the Disease he meanes?\\r\\n  Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.\\r\\nA most myraculous worke in this good King,\\r\\nWhich often since my heere remaine in England,\\r\\nI haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen\\r\\nHimselfe best knowes: but strangely visited people\\r\\nAll swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,\\r\\nThe meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,\\r\\nHanging a golden stampe about their neckes,\\r\\nPut on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken\\r\\nTo the succeeding Royalty he leaues\\r\\nThe healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,\\r\\nHe hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,\\r\\nAnd sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,\\r\\nThat speake him full of Grace.\\r\\nEnter Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macd. See who comes heere\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue\\r\\nThe meanes that makes vs Strangers\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Sir, Amen\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?\\r\\n  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,\\r\\nAlmost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot\\r\\nBe call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing\\r\\nBut who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:\\r\\nWhere sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre\\r\\nAre made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes\\r\\nA Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,\\r\\nIs there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues\\r\\nExpire before the Flowers in their Caps,\\r\\nDying, or ere they sicken\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. What's the newest griefe?\\r\\n  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,\\r\\nEach minute teemes a new one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. How do's my Wife?\\r\\n  Rosse. Why well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And all my Children?\\r\\n  Rosse. Well too\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace?\\r\\n  Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em\\r\\n  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?\\r\\n  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings\\r\\nWhich I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour\\r\\nOf many worthy Fellowes, that were out,\\r\\nWhich was to my beleefe witnest the rather,\\r\\nFor that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.\\r\\nNow is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland\\r\\nWould create Soldiours, make our women fight,\\r\\nTo doffe their dire distresses\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Bee't their comfort\\r\\nWe are comming thither: Gracious England hath\\r\\nLent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,\\r\\nAn older, and a better Souldier, none\\r\\nThat Christendome giues out\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Would I could answer\\r\\nThis comfort with the like. But I haue words\\r\\nThat would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,\\r\\nWhere hearing should not latch them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What concerne they,\\r\\nThe generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe\\r\\nDue to some single brest?\\r\\n  Rosse. No minde that's honest\\r\\nBut in it shares some woe, though the maine part\\r\\nPertaines to you alone\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. If it be mine\\r\\nKeepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,\\r\\nWhich shall possesse them with the heauiest sound\\r\\nthat euer yet they heard\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Humh: I guesse at it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes\\r\\nSauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner\\r\\nWere on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere\\r\\nTo adde the death of you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Mercifull Heauen:\\r\\nWhat man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:\\r\\nGiue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,\\r\\nWhispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. My Children too?\\r\\n  Ro. Wife, Children, Seruants, all that could be found\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And I must be from thence? My wife kil'd too?\\r\\n  Rosse. I haue said\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Be comforted.\\r\\nLet's make vs Med'cines of our great Reuenge,\\r\\nTo cure this deadly greefe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. He ha's no Children. All my pretty ones?\\r\\nDid you say All? Oh Hell-Kite! All?\\r\\nWhat, All my pretty Chickens, and their Damme\\r\\nAt one fell swoope?\\r\\n  Malc. Dispute it like a man\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I shall do so:\\r\\nBut I must also feele it as a man;\\r\\nI cannot but remember such things were\\r\\nThat were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,\\r\\nAnd would not take their part? Sinfull Macduff,\\r\\nThey were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,\\r\\nNot for their owne demerits, but for mine\\r\\nFell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefe\\r\\nConuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O I could play the woman with mine eyes,\\r\\nAnd Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,\\r\\nCut short all intermission: Front to Front,\\r\\nBring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfe\\r\\nWithin my Swords length set him, if he scape\\r\\nHeauen forgiue him too\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. This time goes manly:\\r\\nCome go we to the King, our Power is ready,\\r\\nOur lacke is nothing but our leaue. Macbeth\\r\\nIs ripe for shaking, and the Powres aboue\\r\\nPut on their Instruments: Receiue what cheere you may,\\r\\nThe Night is long, that neuer findes the Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nActus Quintus. Scena Prima.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter a Doctor of Physicke, and a Wayting Gentlewoman.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Doct. I haue too Nights watch'd with you, but can\\r\\nperceiue no truth in your report. When was it shee last\\r\\nwalk'd?\\r\\n  Gent. Since his Maiesty went into the Field, I haue\\r\\nseene her rise from her bed, throw her Night-Gown vppon\\r\\nher, vnlocke her Closset, take foorth paper, folde it,\\r\\nwrite vpon't, read it, afterwards Seale it, and againe returne\\r\\nto bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. A great perturbation in Nature, to receyue at\\r\\nonce the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching.\\r\\nIn this slumbry agitation, besides her walking, and other\\r\\nactuall performances, what (at any time) haue you heard\\r\\nher say?\\r\\n  Gent.

Fye, my Lord, fie,\\r\\na Souldier, and affear'd? what need we feare? who knowes\\r\\nit, when none can call our powre to accompt: yet who\\r\\nwould haue thought the olde man to haue had so much\\r\\nblood in him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Do you marke that?\\r\\n  Lad. The Thane of Fife, had a wife: where is she now?\\r\\nWhat will these hands ne're be cleane?

She ha's spoke what shee should not, I am sure\\r\\nof that: Heauen knowes what she ha's knowne\\r\\n\\r\\n   La.

Wash your hands, put on your Night-Gowne,\\r\\nlooke not so pale: I tell you yet againe Banquo's buried;\\r\\nhe cannot come out on's graue\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Euen so?\\r\\n  Lady.

Why then, Gods Soldier be he:\\r\\nHad I as many Sonnes, as I haue haires,\\r\\nI would not wish them to a fairer death:\\r\\nAnd so his Knell is knoll'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal.

    "A common Python programming pattern to count objects, produce histograms, or update statistics is to make calls to a dictionary as you iterate through a list. For example, given a list of words, you can create a dictionary to store counts and then iterate through the list of words, checking how many times each word has appeared using your dictionary, and updating the dictionary count now that you've seen that word again. The `.get()` dictionary method is very useful in doing this. Read the docstring for the `.get()` method and use it along with the pseudocode below to create a bar graph of the 25 most common words from the transcript of Macbeth which has been loaded into the variable 'macbeth'. Be sure to include a title and appropriate labels for your graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the 25 *most common* words, you will have to sort your counts. If you are not super sure how to do this, checkout out the [Sorting HOW TO](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html) Python documentation. Part of being a data scientist is figuring out how to do tasks that you may not have done before. Remember, in these situations, Google is your friend!"
